title: "COVID Reality - Day 1"
---

First "real" day of what I'm calling COVID Reality. I've been at home working for a week now...

Toilet Paper discussion - Quinton's reaction.

Target this morning to get office paper so Mireille can draw. Every person had a big thing of TP with them!

Trying to make order out of things. Meal times, schedules, areas of the house that can be used for different reasons, like work, eating, food prep, school, and entertainment. We'll see how it goes. Here is our sample schedule:

Ethan and I are working in the office, both on Zoom (which is amazing, but the way)

And... It's snowing...

Lunch time, Mireille's discussion about how going to school at home is a lot different than going to school at school. Her friends aren't around, and she doesn't do morning work on the carpet. Well, she is on a carpet, but not sitting on the carpet, just on a chair on a carpet. Kids are struggling, too...
