Thursday! The last full day for some as they were leaving for various weekend commitments. It also happened to be Jenny's birthday! There was nothing much on the docket for Thursday, so you guessed it, we did a bit of swimming, drinking, and eating.

The week was punishingly hot and muggy for those of us that live in the high desert in Colorado, so we did take plenty of breaks in the very cold, air conditioned house to play games. Pool was a big hit! Quinton played tons of it, probably in no small part due to the fact that he didn't have a phone! Foosball was also quite popular. We did play some Jenga, Scrabble, and other board games as well. There was no lack of downtime activities at this house.

Dan and Amy were on point for dinner that night. Chicken legs, corn on the cob, beans, and mashed potatoes were on the menu. Given that they made 48 legs, Quinton and Tim decided to try to see who could eat more of them. I believe they both reached 7, which, if I had known while it was going on, I'm confident I could have outpaced.

That evening we watched the Warriors close out the Celtics in the NBA finals, after which we retired to rest for the next day.
