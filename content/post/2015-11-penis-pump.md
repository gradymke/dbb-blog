We're redoing our kitchen right now. I have a long post queued up for some time
in the near future to go through some of the experience and show pictures. It's
been fun, but it's also been interesting.

Last weekend we finally got to the point where we could take out our old
lower cabinets and replace them with the new ones. The plan was to demolish
on Saturday and install on Sunday. For the most part this went off without
a hitch.

Demolition brought some interesting finds, however. Underneath each of the
cabinets we found a couple of nice piles of mouse turds. I'm sure the mice
all left when we moved in, though... Well, not so much. We didn't find a live
mouse, but we found two dead ones - and they'd been dead for awhile.

That wasn't the most interesting thing we found, however. Our sink cabinet
was a corner cabinet, which had a large area that was covered by the end of the
cabinet that butted up against it. In that corner of the cabinet, there was a
hole drilled, and some stuff was stuffed into the space between the two
cabinets. I would imagine at one point in Colorado's history this space was
used to store illicit substances so people wouldn't find them - now most of
those are legal and acceptable. We found something perhaps more interesting,
though.

Yes, we found what I'm pretty sure is a penis pump. Jenny didn't know what it
was, but when I explained what I thought it was for, she didn't tell me to
throw it away...

Fast forward to Monday morning. Our friend Micky from Wisconsin happened to be
out on business and stayed the night with us. That morning, she, Jenny, Quinton,
and I were gathered around the kitchen table eating our breakfast when she
asked about the pump. Quin's eyes perked up and asked what it was. I explained
that it was a penis pump and that people used it to make their penis bigger.
He got really interested and asked more probing questions, like how it worked,
_did_ it work, why would people use it. After I answered all of his questions
he looked at me and said, "well, _I_ want a bigger penis."

It didn't end there, either. Later that evening, after school, he was probing
some more and even asked if he could try it out. It was at that point that I
had to confiscate the device lest my have an accident with the vacuum cleaner.
I'm hopeful he will leave it alone because I told him it was dangerous and that
your penis could fall off if you used it incorrectly... You may argue that I
am too honest at times, but I also know when a little white lie is in order.
