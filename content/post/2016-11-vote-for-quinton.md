title: The First Snow of the Year
---

Last week it snowed in Denver for the first time this season. It's a mixed bag out here for snow. People don't really care for it in the city, like most places, but love when it happens in the mountains, where it is supposed to be. My kids certainly love it, at least the first snow.

Mireille has been saying "snow's coming?" since about August when Jenny showed her some snow boots she could wear. When it finally snowed last week, I picked her up from school and the first thing she said was "it's snowing!" As soon as we got home, she wormed her way into her snow pants, coat, boots, hat, and gloves and demanded that I come outside with her so she could play in the snow.

Quinton joined us. He continues to challenge norms as to what should and what should not be done in the snow. While he was out there he asked me to video him doing "extreme tricks" on his scooter. Since that day he's asked me each day whether I had uploaded it to Facebook yet. I'm thinking he fancies himself a social media superstar. Anyway, here is his attempt at becoming a "Tuber" hero.
