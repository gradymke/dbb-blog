Left on the red-eye on Saturday night.
Nothing open in the airport.
Arrived at Dulles at 4:00 AM.
Nothing open in the airport.
$25 cab ride to the hotel 7 miles away.
Couldn't check me in.
I annoyed them into letting me check in early.
Napped for 2 hours.

Back to the airport on the 1:00 shuttle.
Two customs area, asked about it.
Waited - and waited.
Ate at DGM - sort of apropos.
Most popular time to land internationally...

Finally came!
Fataki was beautiful.
Mireille was walking.
Wouldn't look at me
Didn't cry, not even a little. Needed to stay strong for her!

I hope she doesn't have attachment disorder or something.

Chocolate broke the ice.
Wet, WET diaper. Convinced her to change it - just picked her up.
Rode back to hotel.
Immediately dug into the toys, and PLAYED! Tons!

Tried to sit her on the potty.
Ate 3 packages of fruit snacks.
Opened everything.
Packed and unpacked the suitcase.
Loves her clothes! Made me change them twice. Found matching pants in her
suitcase.
Makes me put her shoes on when she gets dressed.
Sings songs, mimics the elevator bell.
Loves to be tickled, but not to have a zbert.

Wow - what a day!

Cried in the car, confused by the car seat.
Totally freaked out by the dog.
Took a bath - she liked it
Quin read her a bedtime story. Gave her his night light.
Slept 9 hours, woke up at 3:15
Jenny got up.

Playing with Quin now, bossing him around.
Making him carry her purse.

Taking him by the hand, making him
