It's taken an embarssaingly long time for this post to form, and I'm guessing I still don't have it quite right. I guess I need to take my own advice that I frequently convey to people at work, the cliche, "don't let perfect get in the way of good." In this case, perfect is getting in the way of memorializing the memory and the event, so I'm going to just knuckle down and write something, dammit!

Ethan graduated from Colorado State University last month! It was a bit of a round-about way that he got there. He spent his freshmen college year at Regis Univerity in northern Denver. It was a nice school, started by Jesuits, who if you are going to go to a Catholic institution, you should go to one that attaches the Jesuit's name to it. It was a private school, so it was costly, but he got some good scholarships and we made it work. At the end of the year, however, he decided that Regis wasn't for him. The main reasons seem to be that, well, they didn't offer a program in the area he was hoping to pursue, Ecology and Environmental Sciences. The secondary reason, far down the list, was that his long time girlfriend, Rachel, didn't go there either.

So during the second year of COVID, Ethan transferred all of his credits including a few that came from High School that he wasn't allowed to carry over to Regis. He rented a room at an apartment off campus, then he did his sophomore through senior years at CSU in Fort Collins, CO.
