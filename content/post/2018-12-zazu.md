We added a new family member this weekend.

Say hello to "Zazu," or "Zaz" as Quinton likes to call him. Quinton has really wanted a pet of his own for awhile now. He has been trying to get us to get another dog and for me to leave the dog alone so I wouldn't be the "alpha male" to this one like I am to Heinz.

So this weekend he talked us into allowing us to use some of his Christmas money from Grandma and Grandpa to buy a Guinea Pig and the accessories needed for it. I think he's a little disappointed so far. The Guinea Pig doesn't love him like I think he wishes it would. It's only been about 2 days, and it appears to be a little freaked out by everything still, but hopefully it will improve with time.
