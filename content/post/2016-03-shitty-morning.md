title: A Sh!tty Morning
---

Mireille's been home with us for two weeks today. Many of you are probably
looking for some post that goes through that in some detail. This is not that
post. I'm working up a larger post, but interestingly, going from two to three
kids, and having that new kid be 3.5 years old, well, it changes how you can
spend your time. Ah, material for another post. This post deals with an
acute familial incident that happened to involve the entire family in one way
or another...

It all started on Friday morning. I was working from home in hopes of getting
some more time with my new daughter, and also to give Jenny a chance to have
10 minutes to do adult things once in awhile. In this connected world, my job
is easy enough to do from pretty much wherever has an internet connection and
a cell phone signal (well, mainly an internet connection).

I was working at the kitchen table while Mireille and Quinton ate breakfast,
Quinton was also watching a show on Netflix - most likely Lab Rats or Kickin'
It - a show that Jenny has absolutely no love for whatsoever.

At this point I should warn you, there are some gross elements of this story
that might not agree with you if you have a weak constitution or if you've never
had children. Last chance. I'm going to get graphic here...

Quinton had to go take care of a morning constitutional. The only bathroom on
the main level is Ethan's (this is the only way Ethan is involved in this story)
and it has a tendency to clog, moreso than other toilets that I've encountered.
Today, luck struck. After Quinton had finished and used about 3/4 of a roll of
toilet paper, he called me in for an assist. It was messy... I took care of
things to make sure he wouldn't go to school all dirty and smelly.

After taking care of things, we attempted a flush to find that, somewhat
predictably, the toilet was overwhelmed by the volume of waste and paper. This
was going to be a mess, as I was going to have to plunge with the offending
matter still in the bowl...

It was about this time that Mireille called out to me and said it was time
for "kosumba," which is Lingala for "I have to go poop." Oh boy. So she came
into the bathroom, took off all of her clothing from the waist down, and
climbed aboard the toilet. I figured it should be fine - it would just be a
little more matter in the toilet for when I had to plunge it, and better not
let her wait too long or I'd be dealing with a filled underpants situation.

This trip was a false alarm, as most seem to be. Mireille likes to sit on the
toilet, grab a couple of squares of toilet paper, pretend to wipe herself, then
flush, and say "I flush it." Before I could stop her, she had reached for the
knob and flushed the toilet. Being clogged, the bowl basically just filled
right to the top. It didn't overflow, but boy was it close! Crap, this was
going to be a bigger mess than I originally thought.

It was about this time that I looked down at the rug near the toilet and
noticed something brown and slimy on there. Knowing there was no way to just
pretend it wasn't there, I dutifully put my finger in the substance so I could
smell and ascertain what it actually was. Ah yes, more poop! Somehow on the
rug... My mind raced - how could this be here? Quinton was an absolute disaster,
so it could have been a stray patch of crap that made its way to the carpet.
What state were his pants in now, though? What else could it be?

I yelled at Quin to come in here so I could check things out. After three or
four calls to him, I see Mireille squatting out of the corner of my eye. Deal
with that in a minute. First I had to figure out where this stray crap originated
from.

After a quick inspection, I found out it was some dog crap on his shoe - he
had been outside shooting baskets a little earlier that morning and he must have
stepped in some of it and dragged it in to the house. It was fresh, though,
and I needed to quickly clean it off of his shoes so he could wear them to
school.

So outside I go to clean his shoes off. That task completed, I came back
inside to find a horrific smell. What could that be now? My nose quickly
directed me to my innocent looking daughter, standing in the kitchen. A quick
whiff of her backside told me that she had finished her "kosumba" in her pants,
sans diaper - she wears underwear...

Did I mention that during this whole time, I really had to go myself?

It was an interesting morning to say the least. Jenny's involvement came while
I was cleaning up Mireille and trying to find new pants for her to wear for the
day. While she was surprised at what happened, she was hardly shocked. Just
another day in paradise, I suppose...
