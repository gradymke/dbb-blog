We're cutting our vacation short! Today was originally supposed to be the day we took a trip on the narrow gauge railroad, but alas, they canceled their trips starting today. We were then going to go up to Telluride to take in the scenery there as well as do some snowmobiling, but threats of weather in the mountains and continued restaurant closures convinced us otherwise. As I write this, the county in which Telluride resides has just issued a "Shelter In Place" order, which is even more reason to be happy we didn't end up there this morning!

So we traveled home - 6.5 hours! We would definitely like to come back to this area in the near future under more normal circumstances. Durango is a really neat little ski-like town, and there seems to be lots of hiking and other things to do in the area. There are also plenty of breweries to explore, which is really my thing...

Little bit of a bummer Spring Break, but it will definitely be memorable, which in the end, is what it is all about. The experience won't be soon forgotten.
