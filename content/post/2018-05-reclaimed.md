title: "Old Blog Reclaimed!"
---

I have a small project going on right now. I've downloaded my old blog from Blogspot and have started persisting it here, in a more controlled fashion - everything all in one place! Since I had over 180 posts on that blog, it will take some time to reclaim all of the old posts and reformat them to properly work here, but the work has begun. It is tedious work, involving some level of digital archaeology, but I think it is worthwhile and will make this blog much more portable in the future.

I will be working to create some sort of calendar functionality on the navigation of this site in the future, but for now you can just do some exploring in the [OldBlog Category](/categories/oldblog/).
