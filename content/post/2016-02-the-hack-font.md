title: The "Hack" Font
---
Sorry, no cute stories about Quinton and the funny things he says today.
No interesting tales about Ethan and his quest to become a driver one day
in the next year or so... Today I thought I'd take an aside and post a public
service announcement on the ["Hack" font](http://sourcefoundry.org/hack/).

Why do you care? You likely do not. However, if you've found this post and are
still reading, let me tell you why I like Hack.

I've been a minor font geek for years. Not of the type that designs fonts,
getting down into the details of the placement of pixels within a square or
anything like that, but I definitely appreciate a nice font, and I have
historically found myself changing over the fonts I used from time to time
just to see if there was one I liked better for different occasions.

In the last year, a few fonts have been released that have made me really
"excited." First there was [Apple's San Francisco Font](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/),
which they created as a typeface specifically for their watch. They liked it
so much that they have since promoted it to all of their mobile devices for
default display. Google also introduced [Product Sans](http://thenextweb.com/google/2015/09/01/google-created-an-entirely-new-typeface-for-its-snappy-logo-redesign/#gref).
I don't know as much about the history of this font, but it was very much in the
same vein as Apple's effort from what I can gather.

Much of what I like about fonts has to do with printing on a page, and that's
probably the most prevalent use of them overall. I know my wife, for one, has
been a big fan of [Jester font](http://www.dafont.com/jester.font) for several
years. I've had some fun at her expense on that one... An area of increasing interest
to me is fonts for use in programming, though. These fonts are somewhat special
in that it is almost always better to have a non-proportional font, meaning
each character inhabits exactly the same width on the screen as all other
characters. This is in contrast to non-proportional fonts, where each character
takes up only the width that it needs (*i* takes up less space than *w*, for
example). In programming, horizontal space typically matters, at least from
the standpoint of how the developer perceives the code. Indentation and spacing
is something to which attention is paid.

There are a number of programmer favorites when it comes to non-proportional
fonts. [Inconsolata](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Inconsolata) and its
variants have been a staple of mine for some time. Of course there's always
Courier, which is a staple on many systems. In the past year, though, Hack has
been released to the world, and is now my go-to font for all monospaced text
situations.

It's hard to say what I like about it better from a style perspective. It looks
great, but I couldn't tell you why. From a non-subjective standpoint, though,
I like that it is open source and free. I've heard rumblings about the great
font wars where people will steal other people's work and call it their own.
Fonts are a highly contested area, for some reason - people that design them
are artists... Hack, though, since it is open source and free, there are no
flame wars or court battles - everybody can use the original, for free, for
any purpose.

Anyway, if you are somebody who uses monospaced or non-proportional fonts on a
somewhat regular basis, I encourage you to give Hack a try.
