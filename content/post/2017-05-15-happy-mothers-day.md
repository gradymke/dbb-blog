title: "Happy Mother's Day"
---

Happy Mother's Day to my kids' mom, and of course my wife, who luckily happen to be the same person! This year we celebrated by going to a brunch at one of our favorite places, Bull and Bush Brewpub! It's a difficult thing to get all of our kids both out of the house and behaving in a public place, but for the most part they held it together through brunch.

What we did with the rest of the day involved home improvement, namely the bathroom project. It's been about 3 months (I can tell from the posts) without the use of a first story bathroom, but on Mother's Day we finally recaptured the ability to expel waste on our main floor!!!
