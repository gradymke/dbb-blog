Last Wednesday, I was able to witness the St. Pius X 2nd Trimester Honor Roll ceremony, and my favorite middle child was among the honorees. Quinton achieved all A- or better in the last trimester. In fact, he got all A's with the exception of one A- which he got in Art.

Congratulations, Quinton!!!

Oh, and just because she is adorable, here is a picture of Mireille in her new soccer uniform.
