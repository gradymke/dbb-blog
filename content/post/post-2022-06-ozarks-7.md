And, that's a wrap! We managed to get out of there a little before 8:00 on Friday morning and traveled straight back to where we came from. The drive was gloriously boring and uneventful. We stopped one time to get food at a Burger King near Topeka, but other than that, it was a more or less straight shot west on 70. Strangely, the winds of Kansas seemed to switch direction in the week we were gone, so they were in our face the whole way back just like the trip there. Kansas is weird.

It was a great trip, though. It's rare that we have a vacation that is as relaxing as this one, and we got to spend lots of time with some old friends that we don't get to see all that much anymore. Sure, we have to go buy a new phone and various things that fell off our paddle boards, but it all seemed worth it in the end.
