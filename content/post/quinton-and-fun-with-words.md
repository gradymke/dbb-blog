New words for the dictionary:

becept /bee * 'cept/

Origin - from what I can tell, a combination of except and besides. Perfectly
encapsulates the meaning of both in different situations.

Example: "Everyone is having fun becept me."

w'bout /wuh * 'bout/

Origin - shortened version of "what about." Not particularly interesting for
its meaning but rather it's usage.

Example: "The moon doesn't have it's own light - it only reflects the sun's
light."

"But w'bout if it didn't..."
