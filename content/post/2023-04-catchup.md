It's been a minute...

Today, Bryce introduced me to a friend of his that is planning an RV trip. Rather than just answering a bunch of questions, I pointed him to this blog, which caused me to go back and re-read it, which reminded me how much fun it was to have these things written down. So here we are.

Well, what's happened... Oh, I got laid off! Yeah, the great startup experiment didn't go the way I had hoped. I mean, I really enjoyed working there, and the pace of work was a lot of fun and all, but the downturn in the market along with the introduction of [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), as well as ALL of the tech companies laying people off, combined for the perfect storm to mean that I got to experience my very first layoff from the _being_ layed off perspective. I have to say, not a fan. Anyway, after 87 interviews with more than 20 companies, I finally landed at [Tempo Software](https://tempo.io) and I couldn't be happier. The product mix is really quite interesting to me - they deal in Agile planning and tracking tools, which are things that I really enjoy working with!

The family is plugging along. Now that I am breaking the ice with this post, certainly more interesting posts are forthcoming. For now, though, this will have to do. Nice to be back!
