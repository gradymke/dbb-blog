I know that I'm getting  behind because my wife has told me that I'm in trouble because of how infrequently I blog.  I didn't even know she knew I had a blog...  Oh well...

Quin's doing great!  He's 7 months old now and is quite mobile.  No, he still doesn't (really) crawl, but has developed a rolling technique that enables him to get pretty much wherever he wants to go.  He's also started to try out the "all fours" thing by getting up on his knees and lunching towards things that are slightly out of his reach.

I'm pretty sure I've written about this in the past, but I have a feeling that we're going to be in a bit of trouble in our household before too long.  Quin appears to be taking after his big brother in the talking department.  He is capable of babbling on and on for minutes on end.  He also manages to use several consonant and vowel sounds.  On occasion he will even try to mimic something that somebody else is saying!

Wednesday marks our court date.  After that, Quin will be a bonafide Grady at long last.  We'll post pictures then!
