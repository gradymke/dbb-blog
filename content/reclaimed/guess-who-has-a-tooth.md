No, it's not Ethan, and it's not Barley either.  That's right, Quin's first tooth has finally busted its way through his gums.  We were wondering why he's been so crabby lately, and the old "well, he's probably teething" excuse was wearing a little thin some 4 months later.  But lo and behold, it really was true this time!

Here you can see him having a deep conversation with an old Elmo doll.  He seems a little skeptical I think...
