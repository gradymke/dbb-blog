As of last night, Quinton has become one of the walkers of the world. He took his first tenuous steps from Jenny to myself last night before bed. Everybody was very excited. Well, Ethan was a little disappointed since he was in the shower when it happened, but was excited nonetheless. Looks like it's time to get the house to the next level of baby-proofness.

Another score for the "nurture" portion of the nature vs. nurture debate. Quinton walked when he was 11 months, 2 days old. Ethan first walked when he was 11 months, 0 days old. These results are not scientific by any means.
