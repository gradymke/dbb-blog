Nothing very long today.  I just have some nuggets from the past couple of days that are worth sharing.

Yesterday we were driving back from KFC and Ethan could smell some of the food.  He mentioned something about how good the food smelled and then said, "Mmm, the sweet smell of french fries!"

Then, today we were outside changing the oil in the lawn mower, and Ethan turned to me and said, "Dad, if you eat fire, then you will fart fire, and your tongue will be on fire, too."  I guess I never thought of it...
