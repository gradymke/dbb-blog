We had our second parent-teacher conference with Ethan's teacher, Mrs. Matyas yesterday.  This conference went much better than the first conference.  Apparently Ethan is progressing very well and doing a wonderful job in school.  He still needs work on his fine motor skills, but he at least knows enough to raise his hand before he talks.  I guess he still loves to tell stories.  In fact, he tells everybody that he is going to have a baby sister.  Unfortunately, Jenny is not pregnant, so that is just not true...  I guess he is the only kid in class that is an only child, and that makes him feel left out sometimes.

Ethan's favorite expression lately is "Awesome."  "Hey dad, look at this, isn't it awesome!?"  He has such emotion when he says it that makes it very exciting.  I think he truly thinks all these things are "awesome."
