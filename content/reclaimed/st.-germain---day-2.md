Day 2 was a lazy day.  The weather was beautiful and sunny, so we did a lot of swimming and hanging out at the campsite.  Along with your usual swimming, running, eating drinking, and sunshine activities, the following things stuck out:

* Quin introduced the world to his "booty-butt."  Somewhere along the line he picked up the term "booty" as a word for his bottom, but he never really dropped the "butt" part.  Now he just says them both.
* Quin and I did a bit of kayaking.  At one point I started singing "Row your boat," and Quin finished the song for me.  He is a wonderful singer!
