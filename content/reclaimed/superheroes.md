It's not secret, Ethan is a HUGE superhero fan.  He loves all things Spider-man, Superman (to a lesser degree), Batman, Fast Guy, who he now knows as The Flash, you name it.  He even thinks Ghost Rider and Blade are cool.  On Friday, he had a book fair at school where he become the proud new owner of a Spider-man encyclopedia.  It is a book that has many of the characters from the Spider-man universe, gives a brief dossier on the character, and shows a picture.  He was very excited to show me "Spider-girl" from the book.  In fact, he told me that he *had* Spider-girl in his collection!  He rushed upstairs and grabbed his most European looking Spider-man action figure (he has very many), brought it down, and showed me, explaining, "see, dad, this is Spider-girl.  She doesn't have very big boobs, but it's definitely her!"

"No, son, she doesn't have very big boobs at all, does she?" I replied, temporarily stunned...  I didn't even know he knew the word boobs!!!
