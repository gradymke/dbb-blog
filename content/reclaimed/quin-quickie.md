I couldn't resist blogging this before my "big vacation update" later this week...

Quin has been talking A LOT MORE lately.  I sat down to try to figure out the words he knew now and lost track.  He's become much more interesting in the last month or so.  Anyway, a game that I always play with him is to push his nose and say "beep beep."  Ethan might do it to him, too.  So now he goes around and pushes people's noses and says "bee bee" just like we do...

Apparently he doesn't just stop at noses, though.  This morning when I was changing his pants, he grabbed his penis and said "bee bee..."  Once I figured out what he was doing, I had to concentrate very hard not to laugh so hard that he fell off the changing table...
