My boys really don't think much, normally, before a Hallmark Holiday like Mother's Day. Last night, however, Ethan asked me (discretely) what mom's favorite breakfast was. I told him that she liked an egg over easy with toast. He nodded, then said that he'd like to make that for her in the morning.

So this morning, Quin (and I, I suppose) woke up a little after 6:00. He watched Garfield while I watched the inside of my eyelids for an hour more. Around 7:45, I heard Jenny stirring, watching TV in the bedroom. After another 15 minutes, I went upstairs to wake up my tweenager who had only 10 hours of sleep at that point, and told him it was time. He asked me what to do, and I told him. While Ethan was frying the egg, Quin made and buttered toast. Ethan got the egg just right on the first try, impressively! Quin then put a carnation in his teeth and carried the plate while Ethan poured some orange juice in a glass and delivered it to mom for mother's day! I have no idea how it tasted, but Jenny ate it all up, so either it tasted fine, or she is just a good mom - I suppose it could be both...

It was a nice day today - seasonably warm and sunny with no wind. Quin and I were outside mowing the lawn a little later in the morning. He was bored, so I told him he could wash bird droppings off the house with the hose (aren't I a nice dad!). While I was getting the hose ready, he was looking in the sky and told me, "the sun tickles your eyes." Well, in Quinglish he said, "the sun tickles you eyes." I had no idea how poetic my 4 year old was!

Happy mothers day to all (mothers)!
