Ethan has been saying some funny things, lately.  First, since it's been Halloween season, he has seen the Grim Reaper walking around on TV and on the streets.  He has been calling him the "Grim Reefer" however.

The other funny thing he has done lately is to sing the song Tootsie Roll.  There's just something funny about a 4 year old singing "Let me see your tootsie role" to me...
