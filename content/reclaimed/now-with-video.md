## Update

the video permissions have been changed and should work now. Thanks for your patience while I learn to use computers...

As my brother pointed out, my Congo posts came out with images that looked like they should be videos. They were supposed to be videos! I've gone through the lot and switched them out for YouTube videos where applicable. Please go through from Day 1 and see some motion you may not have seen the first time through! You should be able to navigate to the posts from the nav-menu on the right. Enjoy!
