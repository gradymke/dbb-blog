Nothing special today.  I just wanted to jot some random thoughts down about Ethan so that they wouldn't be lost.

* The other day Ethan asked me, "Dad, is Jesus stronger than Superman?"
* Ethan has quite an affinity for his "booty."  The other day, he pulled his pants down in the back, exposing his plumber crack, and asked me, straight-faced, "has anybody seen my underwear?"
* He is very interested in babies and how they are made.  He is especially interested in how they get out of their mommy's stomachs.  I told him I didn't know but that he should ask Micky, our friend who is pregnant.  He told me that maybe the come out of their ears.
* Last night, Ethan told me that poop comes from your brain.  Not sure how he came up with that one.  Everybody knows that's where boogers come from, not poop.
