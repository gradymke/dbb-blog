Quin is 9 weeks old now!!!  We've had a good couple of weeks with him so I thought I'd share with the lot of you.

First off, he's now eating about 5 ounces at a time every 4 hours.  Unfortunately, he's still doing that at night as well.  Although, some nights he's been known to go 6 or more hours between feedings, and when he does wake up to eat, he's very good about going back to sleep promptly.

Next in line, Quin has started to smile.  Up until now, smiles were pretty elusive, but as of today he's doling them out to deserving individuals on a regular basis.  Here you see him smiling at his mommy while Grandma Grady holds on to him.  Last Thursday, he was really giving it to his Grandpa Tibbett while giving him an earful at the same time.  Yes, it seems to be that we have another talker on our hands!

Last Thursday, Quin had his 2 month well baby checkup.  He weighed in at 12 pounds 1/2 ounce and was 23 1/2 inches tall.  That qualifies him for the 50th percentile in each category.  He also got his first booster shots, which he really didn't like at all!  Jenny and I heard a cry from him that we hadn't heard to that point.  He was really mad!

Finally, we took Quin to meet the rest of my family last weekend as my brother, Bryce, got married in Minnesota.  He was a big hit, as we knew he would be.  Lucky for us, he is a very good rider as we had a 6 hour drive from Minnesota to our home.
