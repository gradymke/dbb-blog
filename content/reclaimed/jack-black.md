I just found out that my son is cool.  He knows who Jack Black is and wants to see Nacho Libre, and in my book, that makes you cool.

Yesterday we were outside talking about the new DVD he took out from the library.  He said that one part doesn't play very well, and told me that the reason was "probably because mommy put a fingerprint on the shiny side."
