On February 16, 2008 at 10:47 AM, Quinton Edward Grady was born. OK, that will be his name assuming the whole adoption goes through, but since the birth mother has not named him, we will refer to him from here on out as "Quin." Quin was born via a Caesarian section delivery in a Madison area hospital. He weighed 6 pounds 11 ounces and was 19 3/4 inches long. He has a pretty good head of straight black hair and brown eyes (so far as we can tell).

We were able to meet Quin at 3:00 yesterday, when he was about 4 hours old. He is being well cared for in the nursery. While we were there we had the opportunity to feed and change him. He is a decent eater already from what we're told. It's hard to remember hum much babies eat, but they said an ounce was a very good start.

After spending a couple of hours with Quin, we were able to meet the birth mother for the first time, who was recovering in a different part of the hospital. She was doing well, happy to have her pain button. She wasn't real fond of the whole C-section delivery, but was in good spirits. It was nice to finally put a face to the voice and to get at least some idea of what features Quin might have as he grows and develops.

Ethan is a very proud big brother. He made sure that he got equal time holding Quin and took lost of pictures. He even drew a picture of Ethan, Quin, and Dad in the hospital:

If all goes well, we should be able to bring him home on Monday.  More pictures will be posted to Facebook or Flickr, I haven't decided which yet.
