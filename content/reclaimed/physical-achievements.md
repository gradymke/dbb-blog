In the past couple of days, Ethan has started doing a couple of remarkable things (in my opinion).  He has a pair of roller blades that he got from our friends Maylee and Jason last Christmas.  A couple of days ago he decided he was going to put them on, and now he's skating all over the house.  It's really fun to watch him skate from wall to table to stairs all over the first floor.

The other thing he started doing lately was whistling.  For some reason, he thinks that whistling and snapping your fingers are very cool.  He hasn't quite cracked the snapping your fingers thing yet, but he is pretty close on the whistling.

He's been such a good boy lately.  I wonder if it has anything to do with Santa Clause coming to town in a little over a month...
