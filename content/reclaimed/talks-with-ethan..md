It sometimes frightens me to think what Ethan tells people about us. He and I are sitting in the car waiting for Jenny and mom to come out of a store and he's telling me about how he and a girl from school have made up new words to a song that I had made up when I was a kid. Or was a parody to the tune of "this is it" by Huey Louis and the News called "Smell my Pits.". I probably shouldn't be telling him some of the things I tell himâ€¦
