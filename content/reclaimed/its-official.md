That's right, Quin's a Grady!  Poor kid...  On October 2, 2008, we had our final court date at the Waukesha County Juvenile Court to finalize, legally, our adoption.  Largely it was uneventful, but it still managed to choke me up a little bit.  While there we met another family that was finalizing, except this was their THIRD adoption!  Crazy folks!

Quin's getting bigger and moving around more and more all the time.  Today, I'm proud to say, he said his first word that I could understand.  Jenny was telling me that daycare said that Quin had been saying "dada" lately.  When he heard her say that, he promptly said "dada" to us.  We're working on "mama," but hey, the kid knows what he likes!
