        <section class="panel-body">
          <p>The other day, Jenny wanted me to burn a DVD for her to give to a person at church. I told her no problem, grabbed a blank DVD which I promptly attempted to insert into my Mac superdrive. I was somewhat surprised to find that I could not put the DVD into the drive, however. The computer did not say there was anything in the drive&hellip; Quite strange, I thought. I suppose that there could be a disc in there that the OS didn&rsquo;t know about somehow, a computer glitch. So I went to &ldquo;the Google&rdquo; and researched how to force the Mac DVD drive to eject. Having found my solution, I executed it according to instructions. The drive whined and made that mechanical eject noise, but no DVD appeared.</p>
<p>So I did what anybody would have done, I grabbed a letter opener and jammed it into my Mac&rsquo;s drive. OK, maybe a dumb idea, particularly with the power still on, but I&rsquo;m not always the brightest. I was surprised that at one end of the drive my letter opener met resistance, and that resistance moved when I prodded it. So I unplugged the computer (finally coming to my senses) and continued my surgery. My efforts were quickly rewarded when a nickel and 2 pennies dropped from the drive! I wonder who could have put those in there? I suppose it&rsquo;s possible that the computer is actually now making money&hellip;</p>
<p>Well, the story didn&rsquo;t entirely end there. I was now able to put a disc into the drive, but it would not read. By now I suspected there was probably more in the drive, so I unplugged again and this time tipped the machine on its side when another penny and a quarter dropped out!!! In short, my computer somehow generated 33 cents for me.</p>
<p>In the old days, I would have quipped that this was a result of one of my sons wanting to play a video game on the computer - but in today&rsquo;s terms, putting any sort of coin into anything is quaint - so I really have no idea what would have led Quinton (yeah, I&rsquo;m pretty sure it was him) to try to put money in this location&hellip;</p>
