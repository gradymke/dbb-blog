        <section class="panel-body">
          <p>Boy, a week makes a big difference. As of today, Quin is a week without diapers (while conscious). Last Saturday, Quin finally decided that he really, REALLY wanted to wear his light-up shoes all the time. He woke up on Saturday morning and told me, &ldquo;daddy, I want my light-up shoes.&rdquo; I told him that he had to wear underwear if he wanted to do that, and he thought that was OK. Since then, it&rsquo;s been pretty much smooth sailing. Sure, he had a couple of minor slips the first couple of days, but overall it&rsquo;s been outstanding! On Sunday morning when he woke up, Jenny went upstairs to find him sitting on the toilet <em>pinching a loaf</em>, so to speak. In fact, most mornings now when he gets up, the first thing he does is strip down and put something else on so he can wear his light-up shoes. One night I caught him with his shoes in bed with him! It&rsquo;s kind of nice that we really don&rsquo;t need to do a lot of potty training, we just have to find a bribe worthy of our kids training themselves.</p>

<p>Still, one thing is eluding us. Quin still can&rsquo;t manage to make it through the night without causing a minor flood. He still has a diaper on at night, and he&rsquo;s OK with that. We&rsquo;re trying to figure out the magic to eliminating even that, but so far it seems impossible. By the time Ethan was potty trained he had been waking up dry in the morning with a diaper on. I can honestly say that has never happened to Quin. In fact, generally at least once a week he has wet through his diaper and leaked his bed. Our friends tell us we just have to grin and bear it with underwear at night - that sounds messy and hard&hellip;  Maybe next week.</p>

<p>For now, I will bask in the glory that is superior parenting with a quasi-potty-trained child. I realize it is crazy to take such pride in something that literally all children do, but I can&rsquo;t think of a time I&rsquo;ve been more proud of Quin than I was last weekend. It really doesn&rsquo;t make sense, but then again, not much does with this crazy parenting thing.</p>
