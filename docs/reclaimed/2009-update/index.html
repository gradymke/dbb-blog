          <p>Happy New Year!</p>
<p>I hope you all had a wonderful 2008 and are ready to endure what is sure to be an interesting and trying 2009.  I have mailed a &ldquo;2008 Year in Review&rdquo; to some of you, those that I knew could take it (it&rsquo;s a 30 minute video of our family).  If you would like one of your own and did not receive one, please e-mail me and I will be happy to send one out to you.  Now, on to the updates.</p>
<h2 id="quin">Quin</h2>
<p>So it&rsquo;s been a very long time since I have posted, so obviously Quin is doing all kinds of things he didn&rsquo;t do since the last time.  Where do I start?!?  Well he can climb stairs now.  Ethan says he is too little to go up wooden stairs, and I tend to agree, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop him from trying.  He can &ldquo;talk,&rdquo; and he still does that quite a bit.  The only things that are recognizable are &ldquo;dada&rdquo; and &ldquo;hi,&rdquo; sometimes he even puts the two together.  I&rsquo;m pretty sure it is random, though, as he says it not only when he sees me, but when he sees the dog, when he sees a lamp, etc.</p>
<p>Quin is now quite proficient in clapping as well as waving bye-bye.  We haven&rsquo;t quite gotten him to blow kisses yet, but he thinks it&rsquo;s funny when we do it, so maybe soon.  He is also not quite walking, though he can stand for longer periods of time than before.  I, personally, thought he would be walking by now, but I&rsquo;m OK with it taking a little longer than I thought it might.  He is a MONSTER for getting into things, so when he walks it will only be that much worse.</p>

<h2 id="ethan">Ethan</h2>
<p>Ethan is doing well as always.  He had a wonderful Christmas and is very excited about all the video games and Legos he got (along with everything else).  His two front teeth have finally started to come in, so that&rsquo;s good.  He has a strong desire to make a movie.  Tonight he asked me how long our camera&rsquo;s battery would last.  He was very disappointed when I told him it would last only 1 hour since he wanted to make a 2 hour movie&hellip;  The pose you see here is his idea for a promotional picture for his video of him and his friend dueling with lightsabers.  He wants to put his picture on one side and his friend&rsquo;s on the other and put &ldquo;v&rdquo; on his picture and &ldquo;s&rdquo; on his friend&rsquo;s, &ldquo;you know, because that means versus.&rdquo;  Once he has it all put together, he wants me to put it on Youtube.  Maybe I will&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s more, but I can&rsquo;t think of it right now.  It&rsquo;s a new year, though, so it&rsquo;s time to resolve to do things that may or may not happen - I resolve to update this blog at least twice a month.  There.</p>
<p>Happy New Year again, and I hope to hear from or see you all very soon.</p>
