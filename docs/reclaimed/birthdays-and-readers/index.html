        <section class="panel-body">
          <p>Quin and Ethan have been busy folks as of late.  Quin went and turned one and we barely even acknowledged it!  Well, digitally anyway.  In true Grady boy fashion, Quin celebrated his birthday not once, not twice, but three separate times so that he could cover all his bases.  Our favorite celebration was the one we had at our house with just our little family, though.  It was the first time Quin really got to dig into some chocolate cake, and boy do I think he was impressed!!!  Here you see him starting his sugar coma!  It didn&rsquo;t take him long and he was pretty much demanding that he be fed cake any time one of us was eating some.  I had a piece on my plate the other day when he was eating his supper and he spit out the noodles he had in his mouth and screamed until I gave him a bit of my cake!  He may have a sweet tooth&hellip;  Now to figure out how to take advantage of it&hellip;</p>

<p>Quin is developing at a nice pace.  While his height and weight are only in the 40th percentile for his age bracket, his head is solidly in the 90th, which means he really does take after his dad and brother.  He&rsquo;s been walking for about 6 weeks now and is getting quite proficient.  Lately he has even mastered the ability to stand up in the middle of the floor.  The early connection between actually moving forward and hysterical laughter is now gone and he is capable of propelling himself as silently as you could expect a 1 year old to do.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s still a very happy boy.  He laughs all the time, loves to blow and give big wet kisses.  He still loves Barley!  Barley is such a good girl with him, and that is saying a lot as Quin really likes to give Barley big wet kisses as well!  He likes it so much that he tries to hold her still with clenched fists while he delivers said kisses on her back.</p>

<p>We had a bit of a traumatic event recently - Quin finally got a haircut.  We were going in to get his 1 year old pictures taken and decided it was finally time to part with the hair (no pun intended).  He was a very good boy in the barber&rsquo;s chair - he didn&rsquo;t cry once.  He only fidgeted a little as the hair was falling down over his face.</p>

<p>Ethan is, of course, doing well as always.  We recently found out the peril of having another reader in the house.  For valentines day, I got Jenny one of those oh so clever cards that said something like, &ldquo;This card has a wheel you can spin that, whatever shows up, I will promptly provide for you.&rdquo;  On the wheel it was filled with the same task, &ldquo;A night of hot sex.&rdquo;  Yes, yes, very clever.  Jenny left the card on our nightstand, I assume so she could trade it in at some point, when Ethan got ahold of it.  I was walking through the downstairs when I hear Ethan say, &ldquo;Jenny.&rdquo;  I didn&rsquo;t realize at the time that he was reading the card!  He got to the point where he was reading the different options on the wheel and repeated several times, &ldquo;A night of hot sex, a night of hot sex, a night&hellip;&rdquo;  Luckily it hasn&rsquo;t come back in question yet.</p>

<p>Brett thinks that Ethan is destined to be a real ladies&rsquo; man.  Last weekend when Brett, Blaine, and my parents were down to visit, Brett was having a conversation with Ethan about various things.  Ethan declared to Brett that he, &ldquo;[knew] a lot about two things, Star Wars, and Jesus.&rdquo;  Rumor has it that Brett has him lined up to teach him so he can score a girlfriend!</p>
