        <section class="panel-body">
          <p>On this eve of &ldquo;the closest thing the Irish have to Christmas,&rdquo; I&rsquo;m sitting on my couch musing about my hopelessly silly kids.  Nature dictates that the oldest is silly like his dad, but nurture appears to have a strong influence on the youngest.  Too bad - we thought he had a chance!!!</p>

<p>We were out and about gathering materials for our latest home improvement project, built-in cabinets and a desk in our office (the wood floor was finished up two weeks ago).  After we finished getting some things at WalMart we came across some girl scouts selling cookies.  I have a soft spot for kids selling things, especially sweets, so I bought a box of Thanks-A-Lots (I think that makes 10 boxes this year).  Quin has a highly developed sweet tooth and immediately started saying one of his favorite words, &ldquo;Cookie.&rdquo;  We we opened up the box and all had one.  Not more than a minute later, Quin was again repeating &ldquo;Cookie, cookie, cookie!&rdquo;  Jenny thought he was palming it, or had just put it in his lap since very little time had passed and said to him, &ldquo;no, you just had one.  Where is your cookie?&rdquo;  Without missing a beat he leaned forward and opened his mouth and pointed to it.</p>

<p>His vocabulary is progressing well beyond cookie, though many of his sentences are just negative versions of things we want him to do.  &ldquo;No nigh-nigh&rdquo; is one I hear each night before bed.  He has started to branch out, though.  He is very polite and frequently says things like &ldquo;Thank you daddy.&rdquo;  One I particularly liked recently was when I was trying to give him some juice.  He took one drink and said &ldquo;Ucki duece.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not to be outdone, the older one continues to be goofy in many ways.  If you&rsquo;ve met Ethan, you know he is quite the talker.  We&rsquo;re taking a trip to Arizona next month and I&rsquo;m pretty sure he will likely talk at least 20 hours of the 30 it takes to get out there&hellip;  One of our recent conversations was that he hoped he would never be homeless because he didn&rsquo;t want to have to bathe in the lake.  He said he had heard about these fish that would swim into your penis and eat your testicles.  8 year old boys are apparently fascinated with testicles&hellip;  At one point he referred to the fish as &ldquo;nasty little nut eaters!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just today we were watching Chowder on Cartoon Network.  Not a particularly good show, nor would I recommend it for your children that aren&rsquo;t so demented, but Ethan seems to like it.  In this episode, for some reason, Chowder had to prove that he was not a baby or something (I was barely paying attention), so he took off a towel he was wearing.  Ethan started giggling and said, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s showing him the goods.  You know&hellip; his privates.&rdquo;  During the same episode, some fairy things were about to kiss when Ethan announced, &ldquo;Look dad, they&rsquo;re going to have sex.&rdquo;  Well, I&rsquo;m not proud to say that I was intrigued immediately, but quickly realized that Ethan thought that kissing was &ldquo;having sex.&rdquo;  I can&rsquo;t imagine what he talks about in school&hellip;  For those that are worried, I did explain to him that it was not, indeed, having sex, it was just kissing.  I assured him that I would tell him all about &ldquo;having sex&rdquo; when he was a little older and that he would think it is really gross right now&hellip;  He agreed.  Whew - that talk was averted for a little while longer&hellip;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for now.  I wish you all a Happy Irish Christmas, as Michael Scott would say, and I hope your kids give you as many laughs as mine give me!</p>
