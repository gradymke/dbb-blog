        <section class="panel-body">
          <p>We drove&hellip;  A lot&hellip;</p>

<p>We left mom and dad&rsquo;s place by 7:15.  After a Starbucks run to keep the monster in the passenger&rsquo;s seat happy, and a stop at the gas station for some gas and an energy drink (to keep the van and the monster in the driver&rsquo;s seat happy), we got out of town by 7:45.</p>

<p>Not much to talk about here - we lunched at a Dairy Queen in Gallup New Mexico after passing through our first timezone.  There were many, many Native Americans there - the only non Native Americans were us and some old bitty behind the counter who took all her orders on a waitress pad then punched them into the register&hellip;</p>

<p>We stopped for dinner in Tucumcari at a truck stop.  They were announcing shower customers over the intercom which kind of confused Ethan until I explained that they were in their trucks more than we were in our car for this week!  While we were there, a crazy looking old guy with fatigues and a long gray beard walked in, sat next to us for a few minutes, then packed his stuff up and started to leave.  That was before Quin started up a conversation with him, that is.  As scary as he looked, he was tickled pink to talk with Quin and started telling us about his grandchildren&hellip;</p>

<p>After Tucumcari we went off the Interstate and headed north.  It was dark when we went through, but we were warned about the cattle fields by my parents.  I could see a big dust cloud ahead, and once we reached it, we could smell what it really was.  I can only imagine what it looked like, but I thought I was going to die from the smell&hellip;  All in the name of cheap burgers, I suppose.</p>

<p>We finally arrived in Dodge City, KS at 1:00 AM Central time - we had passed through 2 time changes and touched 5 states on that day&rsquo;s drive&hellip;  We stayed at a Best Western on Wyatt Earp Drive which was a very nice hotel&hellip;  Sleep came quickly.</p>

<p>In the morning we let the boys swim and got a little breakfast before hitting the road by about 10:00 Central.  The drive was pretty boring today.  Lunch in Wichita, which contrary to what you might think, is not actually a state, even though there is a college named Wichita State University&hellip;  At that point we got back on the Interstate, a tollway as it turned out, which cost us $8.25 to travel on for about 2 hours&hellip;  We quickly went through Topeka, Kansas City, and finally stopped in Des Moines for the last time.  We ate at a familiar restaurant, Culvers, and we felt like we were pretty much home.</p>

<p>5 hours later, we were finally home.  It was 1:00 AM Central - we were on the road 30 hours and 20 minutes including breaks the previous two days and had traveled almost 1800 miles.</p>

<p>It was a great trip, much better than I expected it to be - it usually is.  I suppose I am a cynic when it comes to traveling with my kids, but they were, overall, fantastic and fun to travel with.  To sum up, here are some parting statistics and random thoughts.</p>

<ul>
<li>In all, we traveled 4063.7 Miles over the course of 64 hours 37 minutes</li>
<li>We traveled in 11 different states of these United States, Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Missouri.</li>
<li>Not all states are created equal - Arizona is beautiful, Texas and Oklahoma, not so much.</li>
<li>Iowa has very nice rest stops and roads</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s no place like home!!!</li>
</ul>
