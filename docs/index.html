    And it continues&hellip;
I believe we are about 8 weeks in to this new reality now. Funny how initially I had all these ideas of things I would do &ldquo;every day&rdquo; during this situation. I was going to blog every day, that seemed like a funny and interesting idea. I was also going to draw something every day, which was fun for awhile, and I&rsquo;ve continued it on a far less frequent basis, but I&rsquo;m definitely not doing anything on a daily basis other than just living.

    Over the past several nights, in the midst of our Corona Quarantine, Quinton and I have started watching the show Locke and Key on Netflix together. It&rsquo;s a nice time for the two of us to hang out, watch a pretty well done, suspenseful show together, and have some interesting banter and conversation as a matter of course. Last night, the episode was a little shorter than normal, and to be honest, our sleeping routines are starting to trend later on either end of the sleep equation, so after our episode was done, the next thing Netflix recommended for me to watch was a show called Sex Explained.

    COVID Reality Day 6 was the Grady&rsquo;s breaking point. There was widespread dissent in the ranks, and those that are supposed to be even and get us through all this were SUPER crabby. Mireille had a big tantrum the likes that I haven&rsquo;t seen in quite awhile, Quinton managed to squeek out some tears at some point, Ethan is cooped up and wants to see his friends and his girlfriend, and Jenny and I were basically not on speaking terms with one another most of the day.

    Today is the first day of what I&rsquo;m calling &ldquo;COVID Reality.&rdquo; In Colorado, while we aren&rsquo;t ordered to &ldquo;shelter in place,&rdquo; anything that would be worthwhile leaving the house for has been closed down, most notably all sporting events, theaters, churches, restaurants, breweries, and bars. Oh, and schools. These closures are setup right now for 4 weeks. We&rsquo;ll see how long it actually ends up being (I doubt shorter than 4 weeks).

    We&rsquo;re cutting our vacation short! Today was originally supposed to be the day we took a trip on the narrow gauge railroad, but alas, they canceled their trips starting today. We were then going to go up to Telluride to take in the scenery there as well as do some snowmobiling, but threats of weather in the mountains and continued restaurant closures convinced us otherwise. As I write this, the county in which Telluride resides has just issued a &ldquo;Shelter In Place&rdquo; order, which is even more reason to be happy we didn&rsquo;t end up there this morning!

    Happy St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day!!!
We had a plan for the day, but we needed first to get some breakfast. That would come in the form of McDonalds and Starbucks, both of which were open, but neither of which would allow you to eat or consume there, abiding by the governor&rsquo;s orders! Quinton discovered the mediocraty but sufficiency of the McDonald&rsquo;s breakfast burritos (better with hot sauce) while Mireille enjoyed her Hot Cakes and sausage, which are&hellip; fine&hellip; The best part about where we are staying is that it is walking distance to so many places - mostly restaurants!

    On Monday at 7:45, we left home, without the animals (Ethan&rsquo;s college canceled their classes the first three days of this week, so the animals could stay with him). We first stopped at Mireille&rsquo;s school to pickup her packet of &ldquo;school at home&rdquo; papers. Then we headed west through the mountains towards Durango, CO.
For the first few hours, we listened to public radio. After about 2 hours of that, we had had enough of the Coronavirus talk, so we listened to a podcast about the space race.

    Spring Break!!! Woo!!!
Actually, as the years go on, the event has become more and more complicated. Three kids in two different schools last year was one thing - but this year, three kids in three different schools increased the complexity. And add to that the fact that I just started a new job&hellip; No worries - we would ignore the adult child, and that will simplify things!!! Well, sort of.

    It doesn&rsquo;t happen very often, thankfully, but I started a new job this month! It also doesn&rsquo;t happen very often that I blog about myself. Both good things, I think!
At the beginning of February, I started a new job with Twilio. Headquartered in San Francisco, I&rsquo;m actually working in Downtown Denver where one of the largest non-HQ offices is located. There are so many new things that I&rsquo;m experiencing, which is sort of the point, I guess.

    It&rsquo;s a broken record on this blog, but it&rsquo;s again been a LONG time since I&rsquo;ve done anything. There is definitely an ebb and flow to my state of mind that really dictates how much I observe of the world around me, and around the end of the year is a time of reflection for lots of people. So here it goes&hellip;
This post is going to read mostly as a Quinton post.
