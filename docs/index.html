    Day 4 - Koalua Ranch Morning Shenanigans The day still started earlyish. Jenny and I were out of bed and walking to the hotel lobby for some &ldquo;coffee&rdquo; before 7:00. We then went on a little walk of the grounds to see what we could see. Unfortunately it wasn&rsquo;t much!!! There are a lot of trails on the property. Good for walking, biking, horse riding, etc. We probably did about 2 miles, but needed to get back to the kids and make sure they weren&rsquo;t killing each other.

    Day 3 - Pearl Harbor Sunrise After our busted sunset last night, both boys were all into the idea of waking up this morning and seeing the sunrise. As it stood, I was able to convince Mireille to come with me! We had a nice walk, but ultimately our quest to see a sunrise failed due to clouds. Oh well!!!
  Bah - clouds!!!     Mireille on our sunrise walk   Windward Drive Our excursion for the day was to Pearl Harbor - perhaps you&rsquo;ve heard of it!

    Day 2 - Turtle Bay Resort Birthday!!! Before I say anything, I have acknowledge the celebration of another year for my beautiful wife and mother of our children. 46, er, 39!!! Happy Birthday, Jenny!!!
  The Birthday girl at Breakfast with Mireille and Quinton   Sunrise After crashing &ldquo;early&rdquo; Hawaii time, I managed to wake up &ldquo;early&rdquo; Hawaii time again. Though I had only 6 or so hours of sleep, I couldn&rsquo;t get it out of my head that I wanted to see a sunrise.

    Day 1 - Travel DIA In typical Grady fashion, we arrived at the airport area about three hours in advance of our 2:30 departure time. Donâ€™t want to be hurried!!! We were able to secure parking for the week+ for around $60 at an off site lot, and even got upgraded to indoor parking since all of the outdoor spots were taken!

    It&rsquo;s graduation week. I have a longer, more sentimental post that I&rsquo;m working through, but I had to jot this one down quickly before it was lost to history. Since it is graduation week, we have family that have started arriving to help Ethan celebrate and to help remind us how old we are.
Last night, my parents, Ethan and his girlfriend Rachel, and Jenny and I were sitting around the table just talking about different things.

    Mireille finally lost that first tooth! It was a few weeks ago, now. She was walking around the kitchen, and I asked her, like I had been every day for quite a few weeks, how her teeth were doing. Her two front teeth on the bottom were coming in behind the baby teeth. On that fateful night, one of them was finally loose enough that I felt confident enough to give it a little tug and evict it from its spot that the other tooth so badly wanted.

    Quinton had an assignment to write a tall tale. Coincidental with getting the assignment, Quin had learned about a competition that his cousin, Graham, had recently done with his uncle, Bruce. For those that don&rsquo;t know them, Graham is a 10 year old, not particularly big, and Bruce, his uncle, is about 5&rsquo; 2&rdquo; and weighs probably about 130 pounds. Anyway, Graham challenged uncle Bruce to a plank challenge. Bruce was able to plank for 5 minutes, but Graham was able to do it for 30 minutes!

    A new year&hellip; It went and happened again, and again I find myself in the position of having a resolution of writing more. It seems a yearly concern, but here goes the latest attempt.
2018 was very kind to the Grady&rsquo;s. Ethan wrecked a couple of cars, but has now had his latest one for over 6 months without incident (knock on wood). Brandon got a new (to me) car in the form of a 2017 Chevy Malibu - yeah, I can&rsquo;t seem to break that mold.

    We added a new family member this weekend.
  Zaz and Quinton   Say hello to &ldquo;Zazu,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Zaz&rdquo; as Quinton likes to call him. Quinton has really wanted a pet of his own for awhile now. He has been trying to get us to get another dog and for me to leave the dog alone so I wouldn&rsquo;t be the &ldquo;alpha male&rdquo; to this one like I am to Heinz.

    The Trip Moab. Or as Mireille would pronounce it, Mo-Ab. Small city of 5000 some people in Southeast Utah, the land of Mormons, backwards liquor laws, and some spectacular natural landscapes. Since we&rsquo;ve moved to the west we&rsquo;ve always looked for a reason to get out here to take in these sights. Thanks to some early travel by Mom and Pop Grady, having come through Denver the weekend prior for Thanksgiving day festivities, we finally had our opportunity to check it out over the Thanksgiving day weekend, figuring it wouldn&rsquo;t be quite as busy or quite as hot as it would in the peak months.
