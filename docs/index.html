    AM As we suspected, and as is typical, we were up way too early. Mireille woke up around 7:00 the first time, Quinton followed about 7:30. While Mireille was able to fall back to sleep for a bit, Quinton was screaming for food by 8:00, so we were up! We left Ethan to sleep while the rest of us went down to one of the dozen or so restaurants the hotel had to offer for a nice buffet breakfast.

    &ldquo;Are we going to the hotel tonight?&rdquo; This is the question repeated at least nightly for the last two weeks by our youngest, Mireille. For some reason she just loves hotels! I think it has something to do with the swimming pools. Perhaps she just likes to travel! At any rate, it had been a constant anthem for the last several weeks - &ldquo;are we going to the hotel?&rdquo;
The day before we left, we dropped the &ldquo;Flex-car&rdquo; off at Rack Attack to get rails and a luggage rack installed.

    Last Wednesday, I was able to witness the St. Pius X 2nd Trimester Honor Roll ceremony, and my favorite middle child was among the honorees. Quinton achieved all A- or better in the last trimester. In fact, he got all A&rsquo;s with the exception of one A- which he got in Art.
Congratulations, Quinton!!!

    I know, it doesn&rsquo;t look any different. That&rsquo;s sort of the beauty of this story. I&rsquo;m going to warn you, if you normally come here for my amusing anecdotes about my kids, or perhaps to be regaled about my home improvement exploits, this story will probably seem somewhat dull. However, I owe this entry to the greater technological community, as there might be somebody, somewhere, that thinks even a little bit like me and are trying to do something similar to what I&rsquo;m trying to do.

    It&rsquo;s been awhile since we&rsquo;ve done any major remodeling work to our house (yeah, right!), so it was time for us to embark on our next gigantic project. The thought was that we would do both upstairs bathrooms at more or less the same time. The kid&rsquo;s bathroom was supposed to be &ldquo;easy&rdquo; since I was going to leave the shower pretty much alone, just update the fixtures and the shower head, but concentrate mostly on the floor, toilet, and vanity.

    We live in Colorado. Our families, by and large, still dwell in places throughout the Midwest. Year after year this generates some degree of conflict, particularly when it comes time for celebrating the holidays. For this holiday season, we celebrated Grady Christmas on the ever traditional weekend of the first weekend of November. For the Tibbett holiday celebration, then, we coordinated an early January celebration. Actually, it was planned to coincide with my 45th birthday, because who wouldn&rsquo;t want to travel to the frigid midwest to stay in remote, rural Wisconsin with his in-laws on their 45th birthday!

    There are many traditions that I&rsquo;ve learned of since leaving the nest that my family was either ignorant to or just didn&rsquo;t celebrate. One happened this morning, and has for the last 21 years of my marriage, yet I still forget to celebrate it - St. Nicholas&rsquo;s Day. Jenny celebrated it year after year, yet I did not, so even though I&rsquo;ve now been in my adult life much longer than I was ever in my parents&rsquo; home, I still forget&hellip;

    Thanksgiving is literally my favorite holiday. I just love getting together with family and friends, cooking a delicious meal, eating said meal, just hanging out and napping with people. I think even more than Christmas, it is the most relaxing holiday out there!
This year, having already done the &ldquo;Grady Christmas&rdquo; several weeks earlier, our plan was to stay put for Thanksgiving. Luckily there are others in the greater Denver metropolitan area that are also too far away to spend the day with family, so they became our extended family for Thanksgiving.

    If you are familiar with our family, you know that we don&rsquo;t really place a high value on vehicles. Basically whatever can get us from point A to point B reliably and without a whole lot of money in maintenance will do. In our particular family, we now have three vehicles, two Chevy Malibu&rsquo;s that have a combined age approaching 30 years, and a &ldquo;new&rdquo; Ford Flex that is only 3 years old, but is approaching 100,000 miles itself.

    Not an interesting update for those that are looking for news on my adorable and smart children, but something I&rsquo;m documenting for posterity, and for my own purposes.
We do quite a lot of home improvement. I&rsquo;ve always been the type that likes to try something on my own before calling a professional in to do it correctly and quickly. Last weekend, a couple of long running &ldquo;curiosity&rdquo; type projects finally had some major movement, which, since I&rsquo;m kind of a dork, made me pretty excited!
