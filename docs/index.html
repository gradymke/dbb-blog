    Is that a contradiction? I suppose it doesn&rsquo;t matter - that is what we have now. Ethan, as of last Friday, is considered by this society to be &ldquo;an adult.&rdquo; He is now able to drin&hellip; Well, he can rent a ca&hellip; Hmm&hellip; He can be drafted, and he can vote, and if he were to do something bad, he can be punished like the hardened adult criminal that he would undoubtedly be.

    Day 8 - Is it time to go home yet? While we love Hawai&rsquo;i, we are all ready to go home. We started the day like most others, coffee at the hotel lobby. We then collected the spawn and did some swimming before showering and heading back to Hale&rsquo;iwa for lunch at &ldquo;Killer Tacos.&rdquo;
After lunch, we decided to do some more beach stuff. We got some stuff, though not as much as we did yesterday, and headed off on the .

    Day 7 - Submarine Morning Day 7 - this vacation is getting long!!! Still fun stuff to do, and so much that we haven&rsquo;t even done yet! Today we had an appointment in Waikiki at 10:00 to go on a submarine! The trip there is about 90 minutes with morning traffic, so we left by 8:00 to get down there.
We took the standard mid-island route this time which looked much different this time!

    Day 6 - Relax Morning at Turtle Bay Thursday, I think. It&rsquo;s sometimes hard to keep track on vacation - especially one this long! So we&rsquo;ll go with Thursday. We didn&rsquo;t have any excursions planned for this day, but that sort of made Jenny nervous that we would sit around the condo all day and play video games. She was probably correct&hellip; That said, we began the morning with some Smash Brothers, as is now becoming a thing.

    Day 5 - Polynesian Cultural Center Morning Well, we are certainly adjusted to the timezone by now. Nobody stirred until well after 6:00 AM, and nobody got out of bed until after 7:00. It seems pretty easy to acclimate to westernbound timezones, at least to a point. I remember the adjustment being very difficult in Manila, but here it&rsquo;s been a breeze!!!
Jenny, Mireille, and I went over to the hotel lobby and got some morning drinks and a croissant while the boys continued sleeping.

    Day 4 - Koalua Ranch Morning Shenanigans The day still started earlyish. Jenny and I were out of bed and walking to the hotel lobby for some &ldquo;coffee&rdquo; before 7:00. We then went on a little walk of the grounds to see what we could see. Unfortunately it wasn&rsquo;t much!!! There are a lot of trails on the property. Good for walking, biking, horse riding, etc. We probably did about 2 miles, but needed to get back to the kids and make sure they weren&rsquo;t killing each other.

    Day 3 - Pearl Harbor Sunrise After our busted sunset last night, both boys were all into the idea of waking up this morning and seeing the sunrise. As it stood, I was able to convince Mireille to come with me! We had a nice walk, but ultimately our quest to see a sunrise failed due to clouds. Oh well!!!
  Bah - clouds!!!     Mireille on our sunrise walk   Windward Drive Our excursion for the day was to Pearl Harbor - perhaps you&rsquo;ve heard of it!

    Day 2 - Turtle Bay Resort Birthday!!! Before I say anything, I have acknowledge the celebration of another year for my beautiful wife and mother of our children. 46, er, 39!!! Happy Birthday, Jenny!!!
  The Birthday girl at Breakfast with Mireille and Quinton   Sunrise After crashing &ldquo;early&rdquo; Hawaii time, I managed to wake up &ldquo;early&rdquo; Hawaii time again. Though I had only 6 or so hours of sleep, I couldn&rsquo;t get it out of my head that I wanted to see a sunrise.

    Day 1 - Travel DIA In typical Grady fashion, we arrived at the airport area about three hours in advance of our 2:30 departure time. Donâ€™t want to be hurried!!! We were able to secure parking for the week+ for around $60 at an off site lot, and even got upgraded to indoor parking since all of the outdoor spots were taken!

    It&rsquo;s graduation week. I have a longer, more sentimental post that I&rsquo;m working through, but I had to jot this one down quickly before it was lost to history. Since it is graduation week, we have family that have started arriving to help Ethan celebrate and to help remind us how old we are.
Last night, my parents, Ethan and his girlfriend Rachel, and Jenny and I were sitting around the table just talking about different things.
