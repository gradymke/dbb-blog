    We lazily started the day, for the most part. Even still, I was up at 6:45, which is 7:45 local. I&rsquo;ve been sleeping pretty well here! Last night when we got into the park we were surprised by the fact that the water was out in the park! We&rsquo;ve been getting used to &ldquo;roughing it,&rdquo; but no shower in the morning - that&rsquo;s a road too far!!! I took a little walk around the park and found out that there was one restroom in the park with water, but it was FAR!

    One week ago we left on this adventure!!! In a lot of ways that is hard to believe. We&rsquo;ve certainly held up better than I would have expected being in such close quarters. This is in no small part due to Quinton&rsquo;s mood being quite good the entire time. He really does seem to enjoy this style of trip - despite all the driving and hiking that we are doing!

    Today started late! Nobody stirred until 7:00 local (Pacific) time, which was 8:00 in the time our bodies were used to. We grabbed a quick shower, got some chai teas and burritos, then headed out on the open road in hopes of making it to the Seattle area early!
The first 40 minutes of driving were much like the last hour of driving the previous day - very windy!!! The temperature wasn&rsquo;t quite so bad, though, and the light of day made things much more positive and the driver much more optimistic.

    Travel day!!! We didn&rsquo;t have a campsite booked for the night, so our next trip was necessarily going to span 2 days. We didn&rsquo;t really have a plan for where we would stop, but we spent quite a bit of time trying to plan the logistics since there was a massive heat eave that started in the Pacific Northwest and was now moving east, right in our path. We were happy that it moved out of the Seattle/Portland area because that&rsquo;s where we would spend the next 8 days or so, but we still had to travel through Western Montana and Eastern Washington, and temperatures were reported as high as 115 degrees!

    Up early again today! We set the alarm for 6:00 AM, had a quick breakfast, then were out on the road for the 50 minute drive to the North Entrance of Yellowstone. It was definitely worth it, again. We beat a good deal of the traffic and didn&rsquo;t have to wait in line to get in, though to be fair, I don&rsquo;t recall seeing a line to get in any of the times I passed the north entrance gate.

    Quinton may well be a blood relative of Tom Tibbett. Certainly he has a lot of traits in common with him, as well as his Grandpa and Grandma Grady. While the rest of us are happy to exist on our own, nodding to friendly folks but nothing more, Quinton is curious and likes to engage people in conversation.
We started more &ldquo;Grady style&rdquo; this morning. No alarm was set and we woke when the spirit moved us, which was around 7:30.

    Yellowstone, wow! The &ldquo;grandfather&rdquo; of the national park system, and it is quite the site!
  The Granddaddy of them all   We started early by our standards. 6:00 AM we were up, teeth brushed, breakfast eaten (waffles and sausage). By 7:00 we were on the road. It was nice to drive the rental car! It could go the speed limit, was maneuverable, and it didn&rsquo;t get thrown around by the wind so much!

    Sleeping in a rest stop has its perks. It&rsquo;s free&hellip; It&rsquo;s close to the bathrooms&hellip; And that&rsquo;s about it. It also has its drawbacks. It&rsquo;s bright (which could be a perk considering some of the other drawbacks), it&rsquo;s loud, and there are a lot of people coming in and out all the time. We were able to fall asleep more or less OK, although it was hot, and we had a hard time configuring Harvee for optimal sleeping without jutting out our bed in the back, which can only be done in camping mode.

    We just arrived at our first stopping point, a modern-ish rest stop in far north Wyoming, near Sheridan. The rest stops are pretty nice here in Wyoming, and unlike Colorado, they allow people to park overnight at their rest stops. We weren&rsquo;t really sure where we would stay, but after stopping at a rest stop earlier in the day, they seemed to be setup properly with enough people around that it seemed safe.

    It&rsquo;s been an undeniably weird year. About 8 months ago, having been cooped up just like everybody else, I made a bold claim to Quinton that we should do an RV trip and that we would buy an RV. I&rsquo;m still not sure what I was thinking, but like I said, it&rsquo;s been a weird year! For awhile, I honestly looked at ways to make good on that strange claim. In January, though, Jenny helped me come to my senses and we decided it would be better to rent an RV.
