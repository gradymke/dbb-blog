    I know, it doesn&rsquo;t look any different. That&rsquo;s sort of the beauty of this story. I&rsquo;m going to warn you, if you normally come here for my amusing anecdotes about my kids, or perhaps to be regaled about my home improvement exploits, this story will probably seem somewhat dull. However, I owe this entry to the greater technological community, as there might be somebody, somewhere, that thinks even a little bit like me and are trying to do something similar to what I&rsquo;m trying to do.

    It&rsquo;s been awhile since we&rsquo;ve done any major remodeling work to our house (yeah, right!), so it was time for us to embark on our next gigantic project. The thought was that we would do both upstairs bathrooms at more or less the same time. The kid&rsquo;s bathroom was supposed to be &ldquo;easy&rdquo; since I was going to leave the shower pretty much alone, just update the fixtures and the shower head, but concentrate mostly on the floor, toilet, and vanity.

    We live in Colorado. Our families, by and large, still dwell in places throughout the Midwest. Year after year this generates some degree of conflict, particularly when it comes time for celebrating the holidays. For this holiday season, we celebrated Grady Christmas on the ever traditional weekend of the first weekend of November. For the Tibbett holiday celebration, then, we coordinated an early January celebration. Actually, it was planned to coincide with my 45th birthday, because who wouldn&rsquo;t want to travel to the frigid midwest to stay in remote, rural Wisconsin with his in-laws on their 45th birthday!

    There are many traditions that I&rsquo;ve learned of since leaving the nest that my family was either ignorant to or just didn&rsquo;t celebrate. One happened this morning, and has for the last 21 years of my marriage, yet I still forget to celebrate it - St. Nicholas&rsquo;s Day. Jenny celebrated it year after year, yet I did not, so even though I&rsquo;ve now been in my adult life much longer than I was ever in my parents&rsquo; home, I still forget&hellip;

    Thanksgiving is literally my favorite holiday. I just love getting together with family and friends, cooking a delicious meal, eating said meal, just hanging out and napping with people. I think even more than Christmas, it is the most relaxing holiday out there!
This year, having already done the &ldquo;Grady Christmas&rdquo; several weeks earlier, our plan was to stay put for Thanksgiving. Luckily there are others in the greater Denver metropolitan area that are also too far away to spend the day with family, so they became our extended family for Thanksgiving.

    If you are familiar with our family, you know that we don&rsquo;t really place a high value on vehicles. Basically whatever can get us from point A to point B reliably and without a whole lot of money in maintenance will do. In our particular family, we now have three vehicles, two Chevy Malibu&rsquo;s that have a combined age approaching 30 years, and a &ldquo;new&rdquo; Ford Flex that is only 3 years old, but is approaching 100,000 miles itself.

    Not an interesting update for those that are looking for news on my adorable and smart children, but something I&rsquo;m documenting for posterity, and for my own purposes.
We do quite a lot of home improvement. I&rsquo;ve always been the type that likes to try something on my own before calling a professional in to do it correctly and quickly. Last weekend, a couple of long running &ldquo;curiosity&rdquo; type projects finally had some major movement, which, since I&rsquo;m kind of a dork, made me pretty excited!

    This was a couple of weeks ago now, so it&rsquo;s not as fresh in my mind as it was when it happened, but the event was important enough that I think it warrants documentation. You see, this was Mireille&rsquo;s fifth birthday, her second in the United States.
For the weeks leading up to September 9, Mireille has been asking on a regular basis about her birthday party. She really wanted to have a party, with a bounce castle, and a cake, and presents!

    Jenny was talking to Mireille on Sunday about things that girls talk about. I wasn&rsquo;t privvy to the details of the entire conversation, because that wouldn&rsquo;t be appropriate - I&rsquo;m a boy. One little nugget Jenny shared with me was when Mireille admitted to her, &ldquo;I wish I was a unicorn. But I&rsquo;m just Mireille&hellip;&rdquo;
Then, yesterday, our little Unicorn proved she listens and absorbs way more than she ever lets on.

    Day 4 Today started out much the same as the last. I got up &ldquo;early&rdquo; and headed out for a quick run around the campus. The main difference today was that Ethan decided he would come with me! He&rsquo;s training for soccer and was supposed to run 5 miles over the weekend. He decided that 3.2 at 9000 feet was a rough equivalent of 5 at 5280, which I&rsquo;m inclined to agree with.
