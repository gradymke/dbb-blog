    Yellowstone, wow! The &ldquo;grandfather&rdquo; of the national park system, and it is quite the site!
  The Granddaddy of them all   We started early by our standards. 6:00 AM we were up, teeth brushed, breakfast eaten (waffles and sausage). By 7:00 we were on the road. It was nice to drive the rental car! It could go the speed limit, was maneuverable, and it didn&rsquo;t get thrown around by the wind so much!

    Sleeping in a rest stop has its perks. It&rsquo;s free&hellip; It&rsquo;s close to the bathrooms&hellip; And that&rsquo;s about it. It also has its drawbacks. It&rsquo;s bright (which could be a perk considering some of the other drawbacks), it&rsquo;s loud, and there are a lot of people coming in and out all the time. We were able to fall asleep more or less OK, although it was hot, and we had a hard time configuring Harvee for optimal sleeping without jutting out our bed in the back, which can only be done in camping mode.

    We just arrived at our first stopping point, a modern-ish rest stop in far north Wyoming, near Sheridan. The rest stops are pretty nice here in Wyoming, and unlike Colorado, they allow people to park overnight at their rest stops. We weren&rsquo;t really sure where we would stay, but after stopping at a rest stop earlier in the day, they seemed to be setup properly with enough people around that it seemed safe.

    It&rsquo;s been an undeniably weird year. About 8 months ago, having been cooped up just like everybody else, I made a bold claim to Quinton that we should do an RV trip and that we would buy an RV. I&rsquo;m still not sure what I was thinking, but like I said, it&rsquo;s been a weird year! For awhile, I honestly looked at ways to make good on that strange claim. In January, though, Jenny helped me come to my senses and we decided it would be better to rent an RV.

    In the movies it is popular to portray computer hackers as these happy-go-lucky nerds who are mainly interested in whether they can do something rather than whether than should do something. In the movies they typically get in over their head, or go up against a rival hacker gang and&hellip; get in over their head.
In the real world, it&rsquo;s hard to say that computer hackers are the same as the way they are portraid in the movies - at least the movies I remember.

    I started this post almost a month ago, that&rsquo;s how things are going! Life in COVID remains largely the same, but is starting to feel &ldquo;normal&rdquo; in a lot of ways. Certainly there are things that we&rsquo;d like to do, like go to the movies, or sit in a coffee shop, or have the whole family go to a basketball game, but in some ways, things are probably better. One thing we have been doing all along with varying degrees of success and consistentcy is to create new rituals to make things a little better.

    Ahh, COVID. I guess life goes on, or we try to do so, anyway. Ethan, after spending the last 5+ months at home (bonus Ethan time for us!) has now completed his transfer to Colorado State University and we have moved him into his dwelling for the upcoming school year! Even though this is Ethan&rsquo;s second year of school, this year seemed almost worse in some ways than moving him in last year.

    Parenting can be hard, obviously. And sometimes we (read I) don&rsquo;t really live up to the challenge. I&rsquo;m hoping this has happened to others&hellip; The last time Mireille lost a tooth was in January. For Mireille, losing a tooth is a somewhat difficult exercise. For some reason, her teeth are very stubborn, and new teeth come up all over the place and don&rsquo;t always displace the tooth they are supposed to replace!

    For the vast majority of this blog&rsquo;s audience (Hi mom and dad!), you probably don&rsquo;t know much about the Youtube generation and what types of things go on here. I can&rsquo;t say I know much more outside of what I observe from my children as they are interacting with these sites, but let me try to explain. In today&rsquo;s day and age, being a &ldquo;Youtuber&rdquo; is an actual profession that people aspire towards.

    And it continues&hellip;
I believe we are about 8 weeks in to this new reality now. Funny how initially I had all these ideas of things I would do &ldquo;every day&rdquo; during this situation. I was going to blog every day, that seemed like a funny and interesting idea. I was also going to draw something every day, which was fun for awhile, and I&rsquo;ve continued it on a far less frequent basis, but I&rsquo;m definitely not doing anything on a daily basis other than just living.
