      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ethan belongs to the ski club at school.  Last week we went skiing for the first time this year.  Since Alpine is close to some friends of ours, we were able to meet up with them and their two kids, one of which, Justin, is Ethan&amp;rsquo;s age.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Justin and Ethan were having a blast!  Justin snow boards, but Ethan skied.  Of course, as soon as he saw Justin snow boarding, he immediately wanted to try that.  Jenny tried to convince him that he would want to do that prior to us going, but he didn&amp;rsquo;t want to until he saw Justin doing it&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
