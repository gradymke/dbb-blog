      <description>Quinton and Ethan&amp;rsquo;s, well, all of our pet Barley passed away on Monday. Two weeks ago she suffered what appears to be a slipped disc in her back. Her back legs quickly became disabled, and over the course of the next two weeks she lost control of her bladder and bowels. She was almost nine years old.&#xA;The kids really loved her. Quin probably moreso than Ethan, though she&amp;rsquo;s been a fixture in our house since Ethan has been around.</description>
