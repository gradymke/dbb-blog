      <description>Last weekend was the annual &amp;ldquo;Tri-ing for Children&amp;rsquo;s Triathlon,&amp;rdquo; a weekend long set of triathlons to benefit Children&amp;rsquo;s Hospital here in town. Jenny and I were both signed up to do the sprint triathlon, a 1&amp;frasl;4 mile swim, 15 mile bike, then 3.1 mile run. We&amp;rsquo;ve done it a few years in a row now, so that&amp;rsquo;s not what I&amp;rsquo;m writing about - this year we decided to let our kids participate in the kid&amp;rsquo;s event on the Saturday prior to the adult races.</description>

      <description>Four years ago I ran in my first organized race since I graduated from high school when I participated in a sprint level triathlon. Since then I got in shape, got out of shape, lost 30 pounds, and have been in pretty decent shape since then. I&amp;rsquo;ve also managed to run in a half marathon, 2-200 mile relays, a number of 5Ks, 10Ks, a 20K, trail runs, road runs, you name it.</description>
