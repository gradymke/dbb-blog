      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;just-for-context&#34;&gt;This post got lost in the draft folder. So I&amp;rsquo;m posting it about three weeks late.&#xA;Just for context&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last weekend, my father-in-law, Bruce Tom Tibbett, passed away. It was a difficult&#xA;thing to comprehend, somebody that we&amp;rsquo;ve been so close to for so long will no longer&#xA;be with us. I&amp;rsquo;m sure I heard it somewhere how Freud describes the death of a&#xA;parent - it reminds us of our mortality. It starts the clock on when we are likely&#xA;to follow. I think that is certainly true, but for Tom, I think it is something more&#xA;as well. He has left a hole that will not be easily filled again in many people&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;lives, my own being one of them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
