      <description>Last summer when we moved to CO, we weren&amp;rsquo;t very busy initially, so we took the opportunity to explore our great new state. This summer, after track has ended and we&amp;rsquo;ve buttoned up most of our backlog of home improvements, we have decided to do the same thing.
Two weekends ago we went to Frisco for the weekend with Maylee and Steve. While there we stayed at a hotel, did a little shopping, visited three breweries (yeah), but the main event was a 20 mile bike ride, 10 miles each way between Frisco and Breckenridge.</description>
