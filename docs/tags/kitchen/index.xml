      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of these days I will get around to posting the epic project that we&amp;rsquo;ve&#xA;undertaken of redoing our kitchen. It&amp;rsquo;s been about 4 months in the making and&#xA;we&amp;rsquo;re hitting the final stretch! Last week the countertops were installed&#xA;so we finally got our new sink installed. Unfortunately, the countertop guys&#xA;don&amp;rsquo;t do plumbing, so that&amp;rsquo;s my job!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had budgeted three trips to the hardware store, and I was right on the&#xA;money!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re redoing our kitchen right now. I have a long post queued up for some time&#xA;in the near future to go through some of the experience and show pictures. It&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;been fun, but it&amp;rsquo;s also been interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last weekend we finally got to the point where we could take out our old&#xA;lower cabinets and replace them with the new ones. The plan was to demolish&#xA;on Saturday and install on Sunday. For the most part this went off without&#xA;a hitch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
