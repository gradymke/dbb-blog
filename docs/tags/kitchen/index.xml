      <description>One of these days I will get around to posting the epic project that we&amp;rsquo;ve undertaken of redoing our kitchen. It&amp;rsquo;s been about 4 months in the making and we&amp;rsquo;re hitting the final stretch! Last week the countertops were installed so we finally got our new sink installed. Unfortunately, the countertop guys don&amp;rsquo;t do plumbing, so that&amp;rsquo;s my job!
I had budgeted three trips to the hardware store, and I was right on the money!</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re redoing our kitchen right now. I have a long post queued up for some time in the near future to go through some of the experience and show pictures. It&amp;rsquo;s been fun, but it&amp;rsquo;s also been interesting.
Last weekend we finally got to the point where we could take out our old lower cabinets and replace them with the new ones. The plan was to demolish on Saturday and install on Sunday.</description>
