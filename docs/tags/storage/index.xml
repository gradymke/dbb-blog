      <description>Thought I would put this out there as I had never thought of this before. We needed to hang our bikes in the garage. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really want to spend too much money on hardware, so we just got the cheap hooks that you can get at Home Depot - they were like $1.50 each. I typically don&amp;rsquo;t like using those hooks because it&amp;rsquo;s a pain to find studs to drill and put them into, and then when you do, it rarely lines up with the thing you want to hang.</description>
