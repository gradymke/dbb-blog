      <title>Ozark - Season 2022 - Wrap it up</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;And, that&amp;rsquo;s a wrap! We managed to get out of there a little before 8:00 on Friday morning and traveled straight back to where we came from. The drive was gloriously boring and uneventful. We stopped one time to get food at a Burger King near Topeka, but other than that, it was a more or less straight shot west on 70. Strangely, the winds of Kansas seemed to switch direction in the week we were gone, so they were in our face the whole way back just like the trip there. Kansas is weird.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two of the families had to leave on Friday morning, so it was just the Chovanecs and Gradys for Friday! Given the smaller group, we decided to do some excursions since logistics would be easier. Of course, we still couldn&amp;rsquo;t all fit in a single car&amp;hellip; Damn big families!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After seeing off the other two families, and after some breakfast leftovers, we headed out towards Bridal Cave, a cave about 15 miles away. The drive was nice. Along the way we saw lots of interesting signs, including one for a bar called the &amp;ldquo;Glory Hole,&amp;rdquo; one for a mini-golf course called &amp;ldquo;Putt Pirates&amp;rdquo; who asked you to &amp;ldquo;put your balls in our puttholes,&amp;rdquo; and yet another one for a sausage place that bragged that &amp;ldquo;nobody beats our meat.&amp;rdquo; The realization came all at once that the Ozarks had a thing for double entendres. And they weren&amp;rsquo;t bad, honestly! Sadly we weren&amp;rsquo;t able to visit any of these classy establishments..&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thursday! The last full day for some as they were leaving for various weekend commitments. It also happened to be Jenny&amp;rsquo;s birthday! There was nothing much on the docket for Thursday, so you guessed it, we did a bit of swimming, drinking, and eating.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The week was punishingly hot and muggy for those of us that live in the high desert in Colorado, so we did take plenty of breaks in the very cold, air conditioned house to play games. Pool was a big hit! Quinton played tons of it, probably in no small part due to the fact that he didn&amp;rsquo;t have a phone! Foosball was also quite popular. We did play some Jenga, Scrabble, and other board games as well. There was no lack of downtime activities at this house.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wednesday (I think, it started to get fuzzy in the middle there) was more of the same. We needed to get the boat back to Pirate Petes by 9:00 AM, so Micky, Jenny, and I took off around 7:30 to transist the 27 miles of water between our cabin and there. It was a lovely drive and we really didn&amp;rsquo;t see a boat to speak of! I think I had to deal with a wake one time when we passed a pontoon going the opposite direction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The one thing we did that was &amp;ldquo;productive&amp;rdquo; on Monday outside of making food and fixing drinks was to decide on renting a boat for a day. Todd and Sandi had been out earlier that day checking out the area and found a rental place called Pirate Petes where we could rent a pontoon that would sit 12 (we had 13, but we figured we would chance it). So this morning, Todd, Tim, and I went to Pirate Pete&amp;rsquo;s to pickup our boat. This was about the time where we marveled at how much the Ozarks area has leaned into the Pirate mythos. I presume they encountered lake pirates at some point in their distant past&amp;hellip; Probably from Illinois&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Day 1, really. Full day 1. Nothing on the plans for the day, so there was little possibility of being late. In that spirit, most of us managed to sleep well past 9:00, even Mireille. We got up and Jenny made some breakfast food that we had purchased, and we eventually meandered our way to the Party Deck!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This property is equipped with many outdoor surfaces from which to party. There is the boat deck, where one could party if they liked. There is the Martini Deck, another party location. There is the deck off of the game room, the deck off of the kitchen, and the main focal point of all water and party activities, the party deck.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to try this one a little different. We just got back from the Ozarks yesterday. Consequently, Jenny and I watched the first episode of the last season of Ozark last night, and they started with the end, so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d try that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was nice to get caught up today! I started out with a nice run - a little slower and shorter than my normal route. Jenny and I got Starbucks, which we hadn&amp;rsquo;t done in a week. The dogs convalesced from their internment in Doggy Prison, er, camp. All in all it was shaping up to be a good day. We cleaned ou the Guinea Pig cage, then spent 45 minutes trying to retrieve Odin from underneath the hedge in the front yard that he decided was his new home&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I find myself, once again, very far out of touch with these updates. One of the things I like best about these updates is the running dialog they represent for our vacations. Given we&amp;rsquo;ve got one of those coming up, it seems a good time to reboot!!!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, what&amp;rsquo;s happened since we last talked:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;rv-update-20&#34;&gt;RV Update 20!&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It seems I rudely left the world hanging on a final update from our Epic RV Trip from last summer! Many apologies. I had big intentions, and even some cool content planned, but much of that is now lost to time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We made it!!! I had a good feeling that we would make it when we woke up in Battle Mountain to see about a 12 hour duration for our drive home. Of course, we are in an RV, so you spend about 25% more time than the map would tell you. Depending on road and wind conditions, I was most comfortable pushing Harvee at about 65 miles per hour, no more. The speed limit in Nevada and Utah is 80. So do the math&amp;hellip; Also, there are stops, there is road construction&amp;hellip; We tend to drive pretty leisurely, and when we stop, we typically do so for at least 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Interstate Highway System is an amazing thing! Of course, it takes a 9 hour drive on a road &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; than the Interstate to really drive that fact home.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today we gave in and pulled up stakes, one day early, and started the 23+ hour trip home. We have allotted three days (well, two and a half) to get home, but we’ll see. The trip today started going back where we came from on Highway 199, with all the tight turns and incline changes that it entails. It was everything I remembered from a few days earlier!!! I again judiciously utilized the turnouts. It took us about 2 hours and 15 minutes to travel the 85 miles from Crescent City to Grants Pass. We figured that would be the worst conditions of the trip! Well, we hoped…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We had a reservation for a tour today and had to be there by 9:30. It was south back to Klamath, CA, so we had to negotiate a couple of road closures and the windy roads, so we left pretty early, around 8:15. After filling up the Jeep with fuel (gah, California gas prices!!!) and getting some much needed caffeinne, we headed back south along much the same route we had traveled the day prior. The drive was nearly the same in all ways, just a bit shorter as we stopped at Klamath Jetboat Tours for our trip.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The day started out with a smash, literally. Jenny was making breakfast on the stove, but didn&amp;rsquo;t quite prop the stove up correctly. After setting off the smoke alarm a couple of times (a feature), she turned the stove off and moved the pan to a different burner to cool - that&amp;rsquo;s when the tempered glass that covers the stove when it&amp;rsquo;s not in use shattered. In her brain fog, Jenny forgot to put it up, and in my early morning fog, I failed to notice. So that was an unexpected 45 minute cleanup exercise and now will be an unexpected expense upon our return. Hopefully that&amp;rsquo;s the worst thing that happens - the stove still works, it just doesn&amp;rsquo;t have its handy cover&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are definitely starting to show some signs of either home sickness or road weariness, but we have one more stop on our journey, so we are determined to finish it off. We started the day off with a bit of logistical fun! Our camp was south of Portland about 30 miles, but we had to return the car to Portland. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to drive the RV back into Portland and have to backtrack to get back south, so we had to figure something out. Luckily we are technology capable! I drove the car back into town, returned it, then it took me all of 5 minutes to wait for my Lyft to come and to drop me back off at camp 30 miles away. Honestly, it should have been much harder! I thought it was also an interesting sign that I happened to pickup the Lyft right outside a brewery - Moon Shrimp Brewery. Might have to try to find one of those, though judging by the size of the place, that could prove difficult. The other thing I noticed on my 35 minute Lyft ride back to camp was that Oregon, unlike Colorado, allows dispensaries to advertise. I found it a little jarring, I guess, but interesting nonetheless. So many strange laws around&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wow, 14 days of vacation! It definitely shows up in some ways. The little things that start to annoy you about the people you are sharing 150 square feet with, like how they chew, or how they are looking with their eyes. We will need a bigger space soon, but for now we are OK.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We started LATE today! Leaving the waking to chance, nobody stirred until after 8:00. In my defense I stayed up slightly after midnight last night reading by the fire. I mean, the wood just wasn&amp;rsquo;t going out, so I had to stay and make sure it didn&amp;rsquo;t start a forest fire. Luckily nothing jumped from our fire ring to the surrounding area.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We decided to take it easy for a day! Our initial plan was to head out to Mt. Hood today, but we decided that we&amp;rsquo;d been going HARD for like 2 weeks straight, so we opted to stay around camp and do camping things today instead! That said, Jenny and I decided to do a 3 mile trail run this morning to stave off all of the calories we&amp;rsquo;ve been eating on vacation! It was a really nice run, actually. Super flat, low altitude, and nice and cool. Just what the doctor ordered for these old legs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Epic RVing with the Gradys - Day 12 - The Oregon Coast</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;OK, first an answer to yesterday&amp;rsquo;s mystery. I&amp;rsquo;m sure if you are my &amp;ldquo;audience&amp;rdquo; (hi dad), you were saying something like, &amp;ldquo;well duh, it&amp;rsquo;s the airport code for Portland.&amp;rdquo; Yes, of course it is that. But why PDX?? I think I have half an answer. Airport codes were first used in the 1930s when airliners started assigning two letter codes to all airports. By the 1940s, however there were too many airports for the codes, so they had to switch to three letter codes. So Portland used to be &amp;ldquo;PD,&amp;rdquo; but when they expanded to three letters, one of the &amp;ldquo;filler&amp;rdquo; letters was &amp;ldquo;X.&amp;rdquo; So Los Angeles (LA) became LAX, and Portland (PD) became PDX. I suppose the &amp;ldquo;D&amp;rdquo; was just the last letter of Portland, so, there you go&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have no idea why Portland is abbreviated as PDX. I will make it my mission before the trip is through to try to understand that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today was a driving day, but we only had about a 2 hour drive in front of us, so it was a little different than other driving days. Jenny and I got up early to try to finish off the laundry from the night before, but sadly the laundry facilities were closed. We were ready to say good by to Thousand Trails, Chehalis. It had some nice features, but overall the experience was suboptimal and may have turned Jenny off to RVing forever! It was damp all the time, it was completely full, there was trash everywhere because there were so many people, the water didn&amp;rsquo;t work for a quarter of the trip, and the toilets were overflowing for a good portion of the rest, and the laundry facilities, while modern, were more or less occupied during the times we could use them and closed otherwise. Oh, and we weren&amp;rsquo;t able to properly level the RV, so we were sleeping down and to the left for the whole time!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, we&amp;rsquo;re about half way through. RVing is becoming a bit challenging. Between losing the water for a full day and being in the Northwest where nothing ever gets dry, people are starting to show some chinks in the armor. One of the men&amp;rsquo;s toilets today was overflowing onto the floor, and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t nice, fresh water flowing out&amp;hellip; We move on tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today we visited Olympic National Park, our third National Park on this trip! Olympic is situated on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington, and due to the fact that there are mountains in the middle of the peninsula, it makes it somewhat difficult to get anywhere. You pretty much have to travel around the perimeter to get anywhere. So you might see something that is 30 miles away and it will take 2 hours and 30 minutes to get to it. We chose the closest place in Olympic National Park, the Stairsteps area, and aimed for that, which was pretty good - it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too busy, and the foliage was very lush.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We lazily started the day, for the most part. Even still, I was up at 6:45, which is 7:45 local. I&amp;rsquo;ve been sleeping pretty well here! Last night when we got into the park we were surprised by the fact that the water was out in the park! We&amp;rsquo;ve been getting used to &amp;ldquo;roughing it,&amp;rdquo; but no shower in the morning - that&amp;rsquo;s a road too far!!! I took a little walk around the park and found out that there was one restroom in the park with water, but it was FAR! I went back to the RV and told Jenny who immediately grabbed her shower stuff and the car keys. She was able to shower while I was waited and also finished up some morning business, then we were set for the day!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One week ago we left on this adventure!!! In a lot of ways that is hard to believe. We&amp;rsquo;ve certainly held up better than I would have expected being in such close quarters. This is in no small part due to Quinton&amp;rsquo;s mood being quite good the entire time. He really does seem to enjoy this style of trip - despite all the driving and hiking that we are doing!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today started late! Nobody stirred until 7:00 local (Pacific) time, which was 8:00 in the time our bodies were used to. We grabbed a quick shower, got some chai teas and burritos, then headed out on the open road in hopes of making it to the Seattle area early!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first 40 minutes of driving were much like the last hour of driving the previous day - very windy!!! The temperature wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite so bad, though, and the light of day made things much more positive and the driver much more optimistic. Once we got into the Cascades about an hour later, the wind had died down, and we started to remember how amazing the views were here in Washington!!!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Travel day!!! We didn&amp;rsquo;t have a campsite booked for the night, so our next trip was necessarily going to span 2 days. We didn&amp;rsquo;t really have a plan for where we would stop, but we spent quite a bit of time trying to plan the logistics since there was a massive heat wave that started in the Pacific Northwest and was now moving east, right in our path. We were happy that it moved out of the Seattle/Portland area because that&amp;rsquo;s where we would spend the next 8 days or so, but we still had to travel through Western Montana and Eastern Washington, and temperatures were reported as high as 115 degrees!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Up early again today! We set the alarm for 6:00 AM, had a quick breakfast, then were out on the road for the 50 minute drive to the North Entrance of Yellowstone. It was definitely worth it, again. We beat a good deal of the traffic and didn&amp;rsquo;t have to wait in line to get in, though to be fair, I don&amp;rsquo;t recall seeing a line to get in any of the times I passed the north entrance gate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quinton may well be a blood relative of Tom Tibbett. Certainly he has a lot of traits in common with him, as well as his Grandpa and Grandma Grady. While the rest of us are happy to exist on our own, nodding to friendly folks but nothing more, Quinton is curious and likes to engage people in conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We started more &amp;ldquo;Grady style&amp;rdquo; this morning. No alarm was set and we woke when the spirit moved us, which was around 7:30. It felt good to rest after putting about 22,000 steps on yesterday (probably closer to 30,000 for Mireille!) I was excited to try my new griddle and camp stove this morning. We had all the fixin&amp;rsquo;s, so I spent way too long getting things setup, and then basically made bacon and eggs. But they were made on a camp stove on a griddle!!! Honestly, it was pretty great, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to lie, though I am constantly surprised at how effective companies are at separating me from my money. We could have done the same thing in the RV in half the time with regular pans&amp;hellip; One nifty trick we did - Jenny gave me the teapot from the RV to heat up on the stove. After about 30 seconds, though, the plastic cover melted off and now we don&amp;rsquo;t have a teapot! Oops! I guess the camp stove is too strong&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yellowstone, wow! The &amp;ldquo;grandfather&amp;rdquo; of the national park system, and it is quite the site!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/pw/AM-JKLUeV7y-9wB0ArzdoLcLNC9aXBvUCDfmqvJuoqfQTtxaS7npYIwYDzkLgsKBHewEWasa1wHWf3HOtNhSdNSaK93OO2Acfr5A_NTIFrlhwIKo1hVNgLGKSsPZ6FzHJ9ntvpJxyaV05H-01E3a_dAYNSmtrQ=w3012-h1696-no&#34;&#xA;   height=400px &#xA;  &#xA;  /&gt;&#xA;  &lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h4&gt;The Granddaddy of them all&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We started &lt;em&gt;early&lt;/em&gt; by our standards. 6:00 AM we were up, teeth brushed, breakfast eaten (waffles and sausage). By 7:00 we were on the road. It was nice to drive the rental car! It could go the speed limit, was maneuverable, and it didn&amp;rsquo;t get thrown around by the wind so much!!! By 8:00 we were in the park, had purchased our pass, and only had another 1.5 hours to drive before we would finally get somewhere fun to see. Yellowstone is HUGE!!!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sleeping in a rest stop has its perks. It&amp;rsquo;s free&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s close to the bathrooms&amp;hellip; And that&amp;rsquo;s about it. It also has its drawbacks. It&amp;rsquo;s bright (which could be a perk considering some of the other drawbacks), it&amp;rsquo;s loud, and there are a lot of people coming in and out all the time. We were able to fall asleep more or less OK, although it was hot, and we had a hard time configuring Harvee for optimal sleeping without jutting out our bed in the back, which can only be done in camping mode. Once we did fall asleep, however, there was a somewhat regular stream of car alarms and horns while people get out of their cars and forget their keys inside.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Epic RVing with the Gradys - Day 1 - 9.5 MPG</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We just arrived at our first stopping point, a modern-ish rest stop in far north Wyoming, near Sheridan. The rest stops are pretty nice here in Wyoming, and unlike Colorado, they allow people to park overnight at their rest stops. We weren&amp;rsquo;t really sure where we would stay, but after stopping at a rest stop earlier in the day, they seemed to be setup properly with enough people around that it seemed safe. Some basic research on the internet said that rest stops were valid for staying, though they recommended NOT parking in truck spotss they needed to stop for legal reasons, so if you took their last spot, they might not be too happy! Not really wanting a mid-night confrontation, I am definitely trying to keep on the right side of the truckers. I&amp;rsquo;ve titled this day 9.5 MPG as that seems to be the average efficiency this vehicle will achieve. No more, no less. We&amp;rsquo;re about 550 miles into the trip at this point and the entire time, even with a reset, Harvee has averaged 9.5 MPG.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been an undeniably weird year. About 8 months ago, having been cooped up just like everybody else, I made a bold claim to Quinton that we should do an RV trip and that we would buy an RV. I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure what I was thinking, but like I said, it&amp;rsquo;s been a weird year! For awhile, I honestly looked at ways to make good on that strange claim. In January, though, Jenny helped me come to my senses and we decided it would be better to rent an RV. Yes, they are expensive to rent, but they are more expensive to buy, and then you have to store them, maintain them, and keep paying for them whether you like them or not! So we decided, even if it would cost us 10% of what it would to purchase, it would be better to just do that, get a really nice RV, and really put ourselves to the test of whether we are &amp;ldquo;RV People&amp;rdquo; or not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re cutting our vacation short! Today was originally supposed to be the day we took a trip on the narrow gauge railroad, but alas, they canceled their trips starting today. We were then going to go up to Telluride to take in the scenery there as well as do some snowmobiling, but threats of weather in the mountains and continued restaurant closures convinced us otherwise. As I write this, the county in which Telluride resides has just issued a &amp;ldquo;Shelter In Place&amp;rdquo; order, which is even more reason to be happy we didn&amp;rsquo;t end up there this morning!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy St. Patrick&amp;rsquo;s Day!!!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We had a plan for the day, but we needed first to get some breakfast. That would come in the form of McDonalds and Starbucks, both of which were open, but neither of which would allow you to eat or consume there, abiding by the governor&amp;rsquo;s orders! Quinton discovered the mediocraty but sufficiency of the McDonald&amp;rsquo;s breakfast burritos (better with hot sauce) while Mireille enjoyed her Hot Cakes and sausage, which are&amp;hellip; fine&amp;hellip; The best part about where we are staying is that it is walking distance to so many places - mostly restaurants! But we were able to walk to both of these places, order in the dining room, then enjoy them back in our room before departing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Monday at 7:45, we left home, without the animals (Ethan&amp;rsquo;s college canceled their classes the first three days of this week, so the animals could stay with him). We first stopped at Mireille&amp;rsquo;s school to pickup her packet of &amp;ldquo;school at home&amp;rdquo; papers. Then we headed west through the mountains towards Durango, CO.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the first few hours, we listened to public radio. After about 2 hours of that, we had had enough of the Coronavirus talk, so we listened to a podcast about the space race. During that time, the mayor of Denver announced that he was ordering all restaurants and bars closed for dine-in for 8 weeks. Well, lucky for us - we weren&amp;rsquo;t going to be affected by that!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Spring Break!!! Woo!!!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Actually, as the years go on, the event has become more and more complicated. Three kids in two different schools last year was one thing - but this year, three kids in three different schools increased the complexity. And add to that the fact that I &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; started a new job&amp;hellip; No worries - we would ignore the adult child, and that will simplify things!!! Well, sort of. Still, with the two youngers in two different schools, of course their spring break didn&amp;rsquo;t line up. So we took the older child&amp;rsquo;s break, took the younger child out of school, and planned on heading to Phoenix to visit with the Grandparents who we haven&amp;rsquo;t seen in Phoenix for a couple of years now. Easy peasy!!!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We started the day like most others, coffee at the hotel lobby. We then collected the spawn and did some swimming before showering and heading back to Hale&amp;rsquo;iwa for lunch at &amp;ldquo;Killer Tacos.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After lunch, we decided to do some more beach stuff. We got some stuff, though not as much as we did yesterday, and headed off on the .75 mile walk to Keiki Beach, home Keiki Pool, which is a natural pool in the beach that is popular for people with little kids with them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Still fun stuff to do, and so much that we haven&amp;rsquo;t even done yet! Today we had an appointment in Waikiki at 10:00 to go on a submarine! The trip there is about 90 minutes with morning traffic, so we left by 8:00 to get down there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We took the standard mid-island route this time which looked much different this time! We got to see the pineapple fields and everything. Of course, it isn&amp;rsquo;t anywhere near as interesting as the windward coast route, but it was still interesting to see in the daylight.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We didn&amp;rsquo;t have any excursions planned for this day, but that sort of made Jenny nervous that we would sit around the condo all day and play video games. She was probably correct&amp;hellip; That said, we began the morning with some Smash Brothers, as is now becoming a thing. Perhaps we will take this activity back to the mainland with us! I&amp;rsquo;ll give it a shot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Nobody stirred until well after 6:00 AM, and nobody got out of bed until after 7:00. It seems pretty easy to acclimate to westernbound timezones, at least to a point. I remember the adjustment being very difficult in Manila, but here it&amp;rsquo;s been a breeze!!!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jenny, Mireille, and I went over to the hotel lobby and got some morning drinks and a croissant while the boys continued sleeping. While we were there we started picking out locations where Forgetting Sarah Marshall was filmed. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of fun recognizing things from a movie&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Unfortunately it wasn&amp;rsquo;t much!!! There are a lot of trails on the property. Good for walking, biking, horse riding, etc. We probably did about 2 miles, but needed to get back to the kids and make sure they weren&amp;rsquo;t killing each other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We took off around 6:45 as the drive is an hour in good conditions, and true to point, it took us about an hour and 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Happy Birthday, Jenny!!!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kXCnbC1DUJibx2_vywr_JWlB4jCdtvoL0t3rGsHUWChi9_6toQpGYx-DAMXvrKCzrrtvD630FWLik1pyqIz6sfHQJrTiD89sSwjhuCYbkEQlG7Fy_kd6PA1niDho4a2Py9CH6O8p9ts=w420-h316-no&#34;&#xA;   height=400px &#xA;  &#xA;  /&gt;&#xA;  &lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h4&gt;The Birthday girl at Breakfast with Mireille and Quinton&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;sunrise&#34;&gt;Sunrise&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After crashing &amp;ldquo;early&amp;rdquo; Hawaii time, I managed to wake up &amp;ldquo;early&amp;rdquo; Hawaii time again. Though I had only 6 or so hours of sleep, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get it out of my head that I wanted to see a sunrise. So around 5:15 I ambled out of bed, brushed my teeth, and headed outside towards the beach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Don’t want to be hurried!!! We were able to secure parking for the week+ for around $60 at an off site lot, and even got upgraded to indoor parking since all of the outdoor spots were taken!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/m3pwUEJLpN5GpfGnT0Co_SaMcWe-rXHCrI_jYjxsvXeEsM_XESmq5f2-MpW5zAIVv6WJ2zpv8XxJjG9SA91ePLwWgMI4CpBoOHlg0jmdE-WGbiMlWu9G3gj1q53SAM7ZdvuvaU0jl2g=w1132-h1508-no&#34;&#xA;   height=400px &#xA;  &#xA;  /&gt;&#xA;  &lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h4&gt;Shuttle on the way to DIA&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/LfsXxQPV78NDA763kccOq0tTkekdGt5h3tlC8fvR7W27YAPGU-zuMKCIMQQwAxRDrEbX7HJrX3rDEw3tdSVREy27tFoYYmD6i8ys0kJyrullrULk3l4n4XrT-Bt8kg7EY_zogdEQWBE=w1132-h1508-no&#34;&#xA;   height=400px &#xA;  &#xA;  /&gt;&#xA;  &lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h4&gt;Shuttle on the way to DIA&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/760jNpdvT2mf2NzoIYmREWYt2yTk1HeXRwJpwhdcrrE33KQF_5knFNf7D8r-4_pvr1Rn8X6UgKF1IKjPqy03PO8K-7OLSqBOOBa6lG8zNb3GXhT3nRMMRBoxQM5slGHqssjbP5J-WEU=w1132-h1508-no&#34;&#xA;   height=400px &#xA;  &#xA;  /&gt;&#xA;  &lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;    &lt;h4&gt;Shuttle on the way to DIA&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The morning went pretty easily. Prep for this vacation started over a week ago with Jenny’s packing, and really went into effect yesterday when we tried to get Mireille’s hair braided, then this morning with a haircut for Quinton. As we sit here waiting to board, I’m thinking back on vacations past, and looking forward to how this one might transpire.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-trip&#34;&gt;The Trip&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moab. Or as Mireille would pronounce it, Mo-Ab. Small city of 5000 some people in Southeast Utah, the land of Mormons, backwards liquor laws, and some spectacular natural landscapes. Since we&amp;rsquo;ve moved to the west we&amp;rsquo;ve always looked for a reason to get out here to take in these sights. Thanks to some early travel by Mom and Pop Grady, having come through Denver the weekend prior for Thanksgiving day festivities, we finally had our opportunity to check it out over the Thanksgiving day weekend, figuring it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be quite as busy or quite as hot as it would in the peak months.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Flying home is tough, but today was tougher than normal since our flight wasn&amp;rsquo;t until 8:30. I think I would almost prefer a midday flight. We theoretically had enough time to do some stuff, but we managed to accomplish all that we had set out to do in the prior 5 days. So it was going to be awkward. As I sit here, we were 3 hours early for our 8:30 PM flight to Denver, but it has been delayed by an hour, so we will be sitting here for some time!!!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our penultimate day of vacation started out early-ish. Of course, we got out to Starbucks and had some donut holes from our new favorite donut shop in California, the creatively named &amp;ldquo;Jelly Donut,&amp;rdquo; where I can&amp;rsquo;t say I ever saw a jelly donut there&amp;hellip; I was a little nervous to be going to the wharf today because it was a weekend, so tourist traffic would be high. Our ultimate goal was to get to our whale watching tour by 3:00 which took off at the wharf, and the website gave instructions to places where you could park inexpensively for $50 a day. Being slightly more tech savvy, I found a spot at a nearby garage for $19 using Spot Hero.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Day 4 - I finally was able to get up in time to hit the road for a run. While I&amp;rsquo;m quite out of shape, I was still able to cut 25 seconds per mile off of my new-normal running speed while in the oxygen rich California air! Almost enough to get me to go out and do it again on this trip&amp;hellip; Almost&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Much like yesterday, today was about doing the things that Jenny and I had planned on doing on our last trip but were prevented from doing due to the wildfires in Wine Country. So after our typical morning routine of breakfast, Starbucks, and now donuts, we headed NORTH this time to the Napa/Sonoma region for some wine stuff.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Friday was all about Muir Woods. Jenny and I had planned to visit here when we came to the area last September but weren&amp;rsquo;t able to make it due to the wildfires at the time. We were lucky to have seen a sign that warned visitors that they needed a parking reservation prior to visiting. We had secured a noon parking reservation for the day, but we were a little early. The parking attendants informed us that we couldn&amp;rsquo;t come until our reservation time, so we continued down the road to Muir Beach, about 3 miles past the entrance to Muir Woods.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After some much needed sleep, we woke up fairly early-ish and took in the world famous Embassy Suites complimentary breakfast! Well, most of us did. Despite getting up in time, Ethan decided not to partake.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first order of business, feed the addiction, off to the local Starbucks. Once that was out of the way, we were free to head downtown for a day in the city. Our first stop was Fisherman&amp;rsquo;s Wharf. To get there we got to cross the Golden Gate Bridge going south, which means we had to pay a toll! Actually we didn&amp;rsquo;t pay the toll right then, we were just scanned. For those interested in how to pay tolls for Golden Gate Bridge, you can just go to their website up to 48 hours after you cross and enter your license plate information along with payment details. Pretty easy. It costs $6 to cross the bridge most times.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been traveling WAY too much lately. After a brief trip to Jacksonville, the boys and I went into the mountains last weekend, then I boarded a plane to Chicago on Monday only to return on Tuesday in anticipation of an early Wednesday departure to San Francisco. I&amp;rsquo;m happy I&amp;rsquo;m not sick!!! Can&amp;rsquo;t say the same for Quinton, however. Jenny called me on Monday evening to inform me that Quinton had been throwing up all day and into the evening. Should be fun!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-2&#34;&gt;Day 2&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We started the day slowly, as any good boy&amp;rsquo;s trip would. Since we didn&amp;rsquo;t go to bed until later, we slept in until after 8:00. I sort of wanted to get going, so I got up and started cooking half of our 2 pounds of bacon and a dozen eggs. The smell was enough to wake Ethan up by 8:30, mainly because the apartment was so full of smoke that I think he started suffocating. No matter, he was up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-1&#34;&gt;Day 1&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here we sit at 521 Elm St. in historic Leadville, CO, our VRBO for the weekend. Ethan, Quinton, and I are doing our first &amp;ldquo;boy&amp;rsquo;s weekend.&amp;rdquo; It was hard leaving Jenny and Mireille behind, but we stayed the course and are going through with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The trip up here was rougher than expected. Traffic out of Denver to the mountains via I70 was somehow worse than it normally would be when we are coming up to ski, but we persevered. We even took a slight detour going over Loveland Pass, a route that we normally cut short by 30 minutes by going through the Eisenhower tunnel, but this weekend is about adventure and doing things that we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t normally be able to do when the girls are around!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;taos&#34;&gt;Taos&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our third day was dedicated to Taos. Having slept in a little, but not quite as much as the prior day, we had a little extra time to do some swimming in hopes of getting away from the crowds in the pool. We weren&amp;rsquo;t successful in avoiding crowds, but we did get about 45 minutes of swimming in before we left the hotel. Mireille, Quinton, and I played some hide and seek (it&amp;rsquo;s more fun than you would think). Mireille learned she could float with her little floatie thing, and even jumped into the pool with it on! Jenny and Ethan I&amp;rsquo;m sure did boring things in the room&amp;hellip; Probably showered or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;los-alamos&#34;&gt;Los Alamos&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thank goodness, today started out MUCH later than the prior one. Nobody really stirred until 9:00, giving Mireille a much needed 13 hours, and Quinton an even more needed 11.5. Of course, I was also happy to finally get 10 myself, though I was up several times in the night for the &amp;ldquo;old man pee.&amp;rdquo; While we all got ready, Jenny and Mireille went to get some coffee at the very convenient on presmises Starbucks in the lobby. Jenny noted when we got back that they rode the &amp;ldquo;alligator&amp;rdquo; to get down to the first floor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;am&#34;&gt;AM&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As we suspected, and as is typical, we were up way too early. Mireille woke up around 7:00 the first time, Quinton followed about 7:30. While Mireille was able to fall back to sleep for a bit, Quinton was screaming for food by 8:00, so we were up! We left Ethan to sleep while the rest of us went down to one of the dozen or so restaurants the hotel had to offer for a nice buffet breakfast. It was at breakfast that I learned that New Mexico is the only state in the union that has a &amp;ldquo;state question.&amp;rdquo; That question is, perhaps predictably, &amp;ldquo;red or green.&amp;rdquo; They are referring, of course, to what color alien they keep at Area 51! OK, they don&amp;rsquo;t mean that - it refers to chili peppers, where New Mexico is the &amp;ldquo;world leader,&amp;rdquo; whatever that means. At breakfast and restaurants it means that you basically get chili with anything you order, and you can order red or greeen chili to your liking. I typically choose green since I am now a Denver native, and that&amp;rsquo;s what us quirky Denver natives like.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Are we going to the hotel tonight?&amp;rdquo; This is the question repeated at least nightly for the last two weeks by our youngest, Mireille. For some reason she just loves hotels! I think it has something to do with the swimming pools. Perhaps she just likes to travel! At any rate, it had been a constant anthem for the last several weeks - &amp;ldquo;are we going to the hotel?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The day before we left, we dropped the &amp;ldquo;Flex-car&amp;rdquo; off at Rack Attack to get rails and a luggage rack installed. We also purchased a travel box so we could finally travel in style. While the car had it&amp;rsquo;s new rack put on, Jenny, Ethan, and I visited the University of Denver, a local private school, to see if Ethan had any interested. Thankfully, he didn&amp;rsquo;t. It&amp;rsquo;s a pricey school!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-4&#34;&gt;Day 4&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today started out much the same as the last. I got up &amp;ldquo;early&amp;rdquo; and headed out for a quick run around the campus. The main difference today was that Ethan decided he would come with me! He&amp;rsquo;s training for soccer and was supposed to run 5 miles over the weekend. He decided that 3.2 at 9000 feet was a rough equivalent of 5 at 5280, which I&amp;rsquo;m inclined to agree with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-3&#34;&gt;Day 3&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Day three started out later than day 2. With nothing really pushing us out of bed, the room slept in. I got up &amp;ldquo;early&amp;rdquo; around 7:00 or so and circumnavigated the property on a &amp;ldquo;run&amp;rdquo; of sorts. Not sure you can really call it a run. Jogging occured, but a lot of walking also occurred. It was very brisk to start the day, at only 36 degF, and a bit of fog made it a little spooky, but it was good to get out and about and get the blood pumping earlyish. As part of my run I found the Heritage farm, a turn of the century farm that has been preserved and now they hold horse riding breakfasts there. There are also some llamas there. The nicest part was the view from Piano Prairie, though. Framed just right, you could almost imagine what it might look like if there were no roads or dwellings of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-2&#34;&gt;Day 2&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our first full day of vacation! Today is exciting because it will be most of our first time whitewater rafting. We were to be in Kremmling, about 45 miles away, by 8:30 for our half day whitewater rafting adventure. So we set an alarm for 6:30, which was fine with everybody considering we were all in bed &lt;strong&gt;early&lt;/strong&gt; the night before, got dressed, had breakfast at the cafeteria, and headed west on 40 to the bustling metropolis of Kremmling via Granby. Fortunately for Jenny, we quickly passed a Starbucks at a City Market in Granby so she was able to feed her addiction while in deep rural Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;prelude&#34;&gt;Prelude&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we first moved to Colorado two years ago, we made a point of being &amp;ldquo;tourists in our own state.&amp;rdquo; It seems so often that we live somewhere and never really get to experience it like somebody who visits. Life always seems to catch up with us. Lord Soccer demands attention, work, school, the house&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s a never ending cycle of demands on our time. So we&amp;rsquo;ve tried to keep it more fresh here in Colorado, since there is so much to see out here (despite there not being any measurable amount of recreational water anywhere out here).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, friends of ours from Wisconsin contacted us and asked if we wanted to spend some time with them in Crested Butte. They have a condo there that they were going to be visiting, and we decided it would be fun to check it out. I have to say, I&amp;rsquo;m glad we did.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Crested Butte is quite a long drive from our home. At about 4.5 hours, it&amp;rsquo;s by far the furthest we&amp;rsquo;ve traveled for this summer&amp;rsquo;s adventures, but we couldn&amp;rsquo;t pass up the opportunity to check it out. It was supposed to be a nice place with a good sized and under attended ski hill. So why not!??!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s right, we&amp;rsquo;re going a little Tarantino here with the time jumping and what-not. By now it&amp;rsquo;s been nearly two weeks and the scars are just starting to form. This will be a blissfully short retrospective on the fifth day of our summer vacation, lest it is lost for all time to the memory of the harrowing experience of the trip home.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Saturday was not at all unlike Friday in most regards. A quick breakfast at the hotel, stop at Starbucks, then off to Regis University for our second and final full day of camp activities. The format was much the same as the previous day - we dropped the kids off into their age banded groups then headed off to our adult talks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Summer Vacation 2014 - There and Back Again</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;9:30 on Monday, June 30, 2014. We&amp;rsquo;re all showered, Quin is in bed, Jenny&amp;rsquo;s powering through another bout with Facebook, I&amp;rsquo;m watching The Wolverine with Ethan&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s easy to forget about the events of the last 36 hours. It&amp;rsquo;s taken me an hour to type up the summary on this page, so I can only imagine how long the actual account will take me. This will be an epic, to be sure. It will only cover about 36 hours of actual time, but I fear it may take me almost that much time to condense my thoughts into the written word. I can promise you intrigue, adventure, horror, romance - well, maybe not romance, but it is quite a story. It will be long. I feel like Tolkien sitting down and recounting Bilbo&amp;rsquo;s trip back to The Shire. This could take a while, but hopefully it will not bore too much.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Friday started our first full day at camp. We had hoped to get a vacation run in this morning, but alas, it was not meant to be. We were able to get moving in time for our 8:30 breakfast meet-up for new families. New families were quite the thing this year with the camp doubling in size or so over the last couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After breakfast we dropped the kids off with their age appropriate groups, each color coded by shirt color. Quin&amp;rsquo;s group, the first graders, were colored red, and Ethan&amp;rsquo;s group, the middle schoolers, were colored tan. The separation ceremony was done in the gym along with some African dance being taught to us by a local troupe of African dancers. We, and most others, were predictably inept at dancing, though Quin made up for the rest of us. Ethan didn&amp;rsquo;t care to have any of us around him for the separation ceremony, but we could see him from across the gym and he looked typically uncomfortable, though he was trying, it was clear.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year&amp;rsquo;s edition of summer vacation is to the Mile High City where we are attending an African and Caribbean Heritage Camp. It&amp;rsquo;s been a few years since we&amp;rsquo;ve been in Denver in the summer, so we were pretty excited to get things started.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The plan was to make the 15 hour drive from Tuesday through Wednesday morning. After 2/3 day of work, we packed up the car and&amp;hellip; waited for Target to deliver some new patio furniture. That could have probably been planned better. They gave us a window from 2-6 on Tuesday. Luckily they turned up at 5:00. It seemed a little sketchy - they showed up in a Penske rental truck and had the back full of stuff. I don&amp;rsquo;t recall if they had uniforms on. Very strange.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Raining again this morning. As we were packing our room, I was thinking on my post from last night and how I had forgotten to put some important color on it. After the mall, the three boys (Ethan, Quin, and Loudon) and I went swimming in the pool. After we had swum for awhile, a couple of young girls came in - I would estimate they were around 10 or 11 years old. At one point they went to sit in the hot tub, where Quin followed them. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even notice he was gone&amp;hellip; I was hanging with my nepphew, trying to show him how to float. A couple of minutes later, Quin comes jumping into the regular pool and asks me, quiely, &amp;ldquo;dad, where do we live?&amp;rdquo; I told him Oconomowoc, and he got out of the pool and went back to the hot tub. A couple of minutes later he did the same thing, this time asking what state we lived in&amp;hellip; Then went back&amp;hellip; It was kind of spooky how natural he was at working these two girls - I was at once impressed and taking notes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The day started REALLY late this morning. The plan was to meet Uncle Bryce and Loudon at the Mall of America (MOA) at 10:00 to do rides and other fun stuff. When 9:00 rolled around and we were still having difficulty getting Quin out of bed, we knew we were going to have to delay a bit. It seems that vacation finally caught up to the 6 year old, who went to bed at midnight the night previous and hadn&amp;rsquo;t slept much to date. He sure made up for it last night!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ethan and I knocked one of our meager goals for this vacation off this morning, we had breakfast at Taco Bell! Yeah, we have lofty goals. We piled down a couple of waffle tacos and breakfast burritos each and headed into St. Paul to take in the Minnesota Museum of Science.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The MMS is one of the better science museums I&amp;rsquo;ve been to, quite honestly. We easily spent 3.5 hours there without even doing a movie! This included the dinosaur exhibit, which was very cool. I learned some interesting new things, in fact. I had no idea what a rennaissance of dinosaur discoveries we were in lately! I don&amp;rsquo;t think I recognized a single dino in the exhibit, they were all new discoveries in the last 10 years or so. My favorite was an entire new class of dinosaurs, the &amp;ldquo;titanosaurs.&amp;rdquo; Very cool name.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We departed Neillsville sometime between 9:00 and 10:00 AM, right on schedule. Jenny&amp;rsquo;s plans didn&amp;rsquo;t have us overtaxing ourselves today. The plan was to hit a couple of tourist stops south of the Twin Cities, then drive up to spend the late afternoon/evening at Blaine&amp;rsquo;s in Inver Grove Heights.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our first stop was at (LARK Toys)[http://www.larktoys.com/] in Kellogg Minnesota. This was not our typical drive for a vacation as it involved ZERO interstate time. Highway 10 to Mondovi, then meandered south to the river, across the river, you get the picture. It was picturesque, or would have been if there had been any leaves on the trees. We stopped in Mondovi for a soda as we were parched, and were surprised at how WARM it was outside! I think it&amp;rsquo;s been so long since we&amp;rsquo;ve felt warm air that we didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to respond, but the day was beautiful!!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Vacation just isn&amp;rsquo;t vacation until there&amp;rsquo;s a trip to the E.R. So today officially started our vacation!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This afternoon was pretty nice outside. It was around 60 degrees, not too much wind, so the kids went outside and played baseball. They were chasing the balls all around the property, including through some longer brush and what-not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a long day of playing, and a long night the night before, Quin was pretty tired. So around 7:30 we decided it was time to start what we thought would be a quick descent into sleepy time, starting with a bath. It was your typical bath, even though it was in a strange tub. Once he got out and was drying off, Quin was feeling around and discovered something strange on the underside of his &amp;ldquo;special purpose.&amp;rdquo; He showed it to me, and I confirmed - a tick!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Grady Spring Break, 2014! The itenerary is quite extensive, to be sure, and the destinations exotic!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The trip started yesterday where we left the house in the van around 9:00 AM, heading north! Yes, you read that correctly, we headed NORTH for spring break. Didn&amp;rsquo;t say we were all that bright! The first stop was probably just off of MTV&amp;rsquo;s list of destinations for this year&amp;rsquo;s spring break, Neillsville, WI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We had the opportunity to travel to Spread Eagle, WI near Iron Mountain, MI for Memorial Day this year. A friend of ours works for a company that owns a &amp;ldquo;cabin&amp;rdquo; on a lake up there, which they allow their employees to rent by the week during the year. When say cabin, I mean a 5 bedroom, 4000 square foot, modern home that is situated on a lake up north. So we joined 3 other families up there for the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The last day of vacation is always the dreaded travel day. We were lucky enough to be able to get some laundry done at mom and dad&amp;rsquo;s before we left (OK, Jenny got it done), so we (Jenny) would not have to do it when we (Jenny) got home. But travel days are always a pain. Most of the morning was spent biding time until our flight. We departed pretty early for the airport - we had a 1:00 flight and arrived at the airport at 11:00, so we had plenty of time to get some pizza and wait at the gate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Great West Adventure - Day 8 - Don&#39;t look down...</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Day 8 was to be a relaxing day! In that right, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too bad. Mom and dad wanted to show off their new winter home state to us, though, so we headed out of town on Arizona 88 around 10:30 to catch up on some history and engineering marvels. Our first stop was Tortilla Flat, a (very) small stop on the way up to the Roosevelt Dam on the Salt River. What might be said about Tortilla Flat is that it is the last sane place to stop on Hwy 88 before you wish you had brought a dune buggy! After spending a short time in Tortilla Flat getting a beer and looking through some of the buildings, we headed out again on 88 with a destination of the Roosevelt Dam. 88, however, was the real attraction of today&amp;rsquo;s trip. All along my dad was explaining to me how horrendous this road was, and let me drive to prove it to me. Of course I didn&amp;rsquo;t really take this all that seriously - he&amp;rsquo;s old, right!? Well, let me be the first to admit that this is far and away the nastiest drive I&amp;rsquo;ve taken in all my years. Not only is it a curvy, mountainous road with little or not shoulder or barrier between the road and the canyon floor many hundreds of feet down, but the road is unpaved and, seemingly, ribbed (for her pleasure). I&amp;rsquo;m not sure of the science behind dirt roads and why they get so bumpy, but this one seemed to have been made so on purpose, perhaps to keep people from going more than about 15 miles per hour. Anyway, our 28 mile trek from Tortilla Flat to Roosevelt Dam took well over an hour. We did stop for some lunch along the way at Apache Lake where Quin started out napping, and upon waking half way through the meal asked us &amp;ldquo;where is everybody?&amp;rdquo; Business was not bustling in Apache Lake today!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There was no plan in the works for today other than to drive back to Phoenix at some point. Small portion of the day, only 6.5 hours&amp;hellip; Surprisingly, though, it seemed relaxed since we didn&amp;rsquo;t have an itinerary. So we started out the day like we did any other day on vacation, we ate at a local breakfast establishment. This time we found a local favorite, Panera Bread. Excellent bagels and sandwiches - oh who am I kidding, we just wanted something fast.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Great West Adventure - Day 6 - It&#39;s a zoo out there</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In case there was any question to the subtitle of yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post, we were watching the weather where the cute weather lady exclaimed that the clouds were pretty moist and deep, and that she wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised to see them start to rain at any time. I found that amusing - I suppose I&amp;rsquo;ve never really progressed past the age of 12 as far as my maturity level goes&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I again find myself 3 days tardy in posting this, so I think this will be pretty short. Today was about the zoo. The day started out a bit earlier than any of us would have liked. Around 6:25 AM, the hotel&amp;rsquo;s fire alarm system started going crazy. We awoke in a daze, but figured out what was going on well enough to put some clothes on, grab our &amp;ldquo;necessities,&amp;rdquo; (my wallet and keys to the car - oh, and the kids), and get outside. We weren&amp;rsquo;t outside more than a couple of minutes before they gave us the all clear stating that it was a false alarm. No kidding&amp;hellip; By this time, Quin was finally starting to wake up. As I was holding him in my arms, he took his head off my shoulder, looked up at me and said, &amp;ldquo;please I push the button?&amp;rdquo; Apparently to a kid of three, pushing the elevator button is pretty much the coolest thing you could ever hope to do. The entire week he would dash to the elevator anytime we hinted at going up or down in it. Ethan caught on, being the mean big brother, and taunted him at every turn, threatening to push the button instead of him, sometimes succeeding. Of course, being the opportunistic parents that we are, we used it as leverage to get Quin to do the things we wanted him to do. So, whenever we were heading to the elevator, he would ask us if he could be the one to push the button&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Man, I have to start doing these as they happen. This is my third log today!!! To get me through it, I&amp;rsquo;ve gone to the fridge to finish off my San Diego brew sampler with a Karl Strauss Brewing Company Boardwalk Black Rye. Tasty!!!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s plan was to go to Seaworld. We figured we would do things a little differently today since we completely missed supper yesterday, so we opted for a smaller breakfast of Subway sandwiches and Starbucks. After breakfast we headed north to Seaworld, San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Day 4 - San Diego. Today started out early with Quin waking around 6:00 - he&amp;rsquo;s getting better. He and I passed time playing iOS games on the iPhone and iPad in the second room of our suite while Jenny and Ethan grabbed 90 more minutes of sleep. By 7:30, Jenny got up and I hit the road for a quick run along the water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By 9:00 we were off for a full day of vacationing. We decided to load up on breakfast since our plans for the day included Legoland, and our guess was that food would be somewhat expensive there. So I mapped out Perry&amp;rsquo;s Cafe near the freeway where we all ate enough to skip the next several meals - well, I did anyway! Delicious!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since we were up by 6:00 anyway, we decided to try to get an early start at things, so we got ready and left by 8:00. My parents graciously lent us their vehicle - they are currently going without any sort of motorized vehicle of their own, relying instead on pedal power and favors from friends - so we loaded it up and took off on our 6 and 1/2 hour drive to San Diego. Before we left town we had to make a quick stop at Starbucks to get Jenny her vacation nectar, Tall non-fat Chai Tea Latte, and at the gas station for a Pepsi Max for me - it&amp;rsquo;s not a diet soda, it&amp;rsquo;s a zero calorie soda for &lt;em&gt;men&lt;/em&gt;! At one point, Quinton asked &amp;ldquo;where are we going?&amp;rdquo; I explained we were going to Starbucks to get mommy a coffee - he responded, &amp;ldquo;oh darn it, I wanted to go to California.&amp;rdquo; I need to take this opportunity to say that the gas station/car wash/oil change establishment at the intersection of Highway 60 and Signal Butte Drive in Apache Junction is perhaps the most beautiful gas station I&amp;rsquo;ve ever encountered. From the clean, modern, southwest exterior, to the wide aisles, copious beverage choice, leather chairs, high definition televisions while you wait&amp;hellip; It was spectacular!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As should probably be expected, since Quin went to bed at around 6:00 local time, he woke up around 4:30 local. I suppose the day was going to start early! We aimed to do quite a bit during this day, but ultimately decided to back it off a bit seeing as how we were still a bit groggy from the previous day&amp;rsquo;s travels. We did manage to get to the (Superstition Mountain Museum)[http://www.superstitionmountainmuseum.org/] which is the site of an old Hollywood set for westerns which only recently burned to the ground. We also spent some time at (Goldfield Ghost Town)[http://www.superstitionmountainmuseum.org/] where we got to see a gunfight, Ethan bought a cowboy hat, and we ended up taking in some old west entertainment at the Saloon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Great West Adventure - Day 1</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;3:45 AM - the alarm called out the start of our Great West Adventure. We were ticketed for a 7:00 departure from Milwaukee&amp;rsquo;s General Mitchell Airport. With 3 and 10 year old in tow, we didn&amp;rsquo;t want to leave anything to risk. So we all showered the night before, set the alarm for 3:45, and aimed to leave by 4:15.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The plan went off without a hitch - the crew was excited for the trip. We pulled into our offsite parking lot at 5:10, plenty of time to spare. I suppose we could have probably slept a little longer, but who knows on a work day how bad traffic will get. After a quick shuttle ride we were at the ticketing counter, then off to the gate to meet up with our first trip on Southwest Airlines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ski Vacation - Part II</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tuesday was another ski day. This time it was adult ski day. Quin was going back to school, and Ethan was enrolled in Woodward, an indoor extreme ski and snowboard school. The warehouse is immense with fake snow ramps that empty into foam pits and trampoline sections to teach people how to tumble with ease through the air. I think Ethan was in for a fun day!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ethan and I went down to Woodward to drop him off while Jenny dropped Quin off at school. Apparently this day wasn&amp;rsquo;t as easy to drop off as the previous - Quin really didn&amp;rsquo;t want to go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;OK, I hope this goes away like almost all other things, because if it comes back and is something serious, I will look like a schmuck. But Ethan had his little spell with sickness yesterday, during which he thought he was going to throw up. He is a fan of the drama! Today, he has a low grade headache as far as I can tell, because he&amp;rsquo;s running around, tubing, and being a general 9 year old menace, but after sitting on the couch for 30 minutes drinking water and eating popcorn he started complaining of a headache again. He stood in the kitchen, looked at me, and said, &amp;ldquo;I hope this isn&amp;rsquo;t something serious. It probably is, though. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a headache for 2 days now - that&amp;rsquo;s not normal, dad!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I sit here in our rented condo, Ethan and Jenny are sitting on the couch studying social studies (Jenny struggles, so they need to study), Quin is watching Monsters, Inc. on the iPad, it is brisk and snowing outside while the gas fire burns warmly in the fireplace. Our first ski vacation in 7 years is in full swing!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This vacation finds us in the beautiful US Rocky Mountains outside of Denver, CO. Though we&amp;rsquo;re already settled and active in our vacation activities, the trip started many days ago. Last Wednesday to be exact. We had settled down for a typical evening at home - Quin and Ethan were sleeping soundly in their beds while Jenny and I attempted to get some last minute television in before our whirlwind trip to Colorado. All seemed normal, that is until 10:30 when Quin called out from upstairs. It&amp;rsquo;s not atypical for him to wake up from time to time, particularly early in the evening. I slowly made my way upstairs to check on him. As I started walking down the hall, the door to his room opened and he walked out, covered in vomit. Awesome! Here we were, less than 48 hours from leaving for our trip, and Quin had come down with the flu! He was up the better part of the night, mostly dry heaving as he had done a pretty good job of emptying his stomach on round 1.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was windy and cool today, and I am training for a 1/2 marathon, so I picked today to do my long run of the week.  I mapped out a route before we left that took me around the entire lake.  While I was supposed to run only 10 miles, the prospect and symmetry of running around the entire lake was too good to pass up, so Tim Z. and I ended up running a little over 11.5 miles.  It took us a long time, and it was hilly, but we did it.  I now feel I&amp;rsquo;m ready for the 1/2 in a little over a week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Still a little cool to start the day, so Quin and I made bacon and egg sandwiches for breakfast before we headed out fishing with Tim and Logan Ziegler.  The fishing wasn&amp;rsquo;t all that great, but we did have a close encounter with an eagle.  It was pretty awesome, actually.  We heard something heavy in the trees, then the eagle flew just above the water not more than about 20 feet from the boat.  He skimmed the water across the lake, picked something up, then reversed his path and came right back past us again.  He perched up in a tree and ate whatever he picked up in the lake.  Thinking back on it I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but think about the double rainbow guy on YouTube.  I had thoughts of me saying, &amp;ldquo;An eagle!  What does it mean?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night was an early one - we were all pretty beat from 5 days of vacation, so by 10:00 pretty much everybody was in bed already.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today started warmer, but still windy.  After Jenny and I each had a run we ran into town to get some chai tea and a smoothie.  We then ventured into Eagle River to hit the liquor store.  All that took a surprisingly long time.  By the time we got back it was lunch time!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was my morning to get up with Quin.  He didn&amp;rsquo;t go to bed until 10:00 last night, so it was a bit of a surprise when he got up at 6:00 like normal.  Luckily I just convinced him to lay down and within about 10 seconds he fell back to sleep until 8:00.  By that time his diaper was a wreck!  I was changing the mess that had accumulated saying something about &amp;ldquo;stinky poop&amp;rdquo; or something, and Quin said &amp;ldquo;I poop potty.&amp;rdquo;  I asked him, &amp;ldquo;really?&amp;rdquo;  Quoting a perfect Donkey from Shrek he said, &amp;ldquo;Really, really.&amp;rdquo;  Chalk another one up to nurture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;All good things must come to an end.  We pretty much just got up and left first thing on Sunday morning.  It was looking like a very hot day, and the time we did spend outside packing the cars found us swatting at a lot of mosquitoes which had been very sparse the rest of the week.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lots of interesting things happened during the week, but here is a quick summary of some of the more memorable things:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The trip started out somewhat inauspiciously.  I had neglected to pack anything - Jenny packed all the kids&amp;rsquo; stuff as well as mine, but there was still a pile of things that I needed to take care of the morning of our departure.  My parents, Blaine, and Brett along with respective lady friends of each of theirs joined us the day prior to celebrate mom and dad&amp;rsquo;s 39th wedding anniversary by going to IrishFest in Milwaukee.  It was a good time, but afforded us a little less &amp;ldquo;last minute&amp;rdquo; packing time than normal.  I thought we would be fine as long as we just packed in the morning&amp;hellip;  It seemed Karma didn&amp;rsquo;t want us to leave, for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Day 2 was a lazy day.  The weather was beautiful and sunny, so we did a lot of swimming and hanging out at the campsite.  Along with your usual swimming, running, eating drinking, and sunshine activities, the following things stuck out:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Quin introduced the world to his &amp;ldquo;booty-butt.&amp;rdquo;  Somewhere along the line he picked up the term &amp;ldquo;booty&amp;rdquo; as a word for his bottom, but he never really dropped the &amp;ldquo;butt&amp;rdquo; part.  Now he just says them both.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Quin and I did a bit of kayaking.  At one point I started singing &amp;ldquo;Row your boat,&amp;rdquo; and Quin finished the song for me.  He is a wonderful singer!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jenny&amp;rsquo;s parents stayed with us last night, so Ethan went to sleep at Jacob&amp;rsquo;s cabin with the Abholds.  That didn&amp;rsquo;t last too long, unfortunately.  At about 1:30 we heard somebody talking to us through our window - it was Micky telling us that Jacob had gotten sick and that Ethan was now feeling sick, so she was returning him to us for the night.  So much for that idea&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By morning, Ethan was feeling fine.  It was rainy and a little cold today, so we went up to the U.P. to check out a waterfall up there.  It was pretty awesome.  Bond Falls, it was called (I think).  One really neat thing about it was all the trails around the falls.  They had some permanent, wood trails built that gave you very good access to the entirety of the bottom of the falls.  They then had some &amp;ldquo;off road&amp;rdquo; trails you could take up the side of the falls on one side, and a paved set of stairs on the other side.  Ethan found his way up the non-paved side and made us all follow him, but it was worth it.  What views!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We drove&amp;hellip;  A lot&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We left mom and dad&amp;rsquo;s place by 7:15.  After a Starbucks run to keep the monster in the passenger&amp;rsquo;s seat happy, and a stop at the gas station for some gas and an energy drink (to keep the van and the monster in the driver&amp;rsquo;s seat happy), we got out of town by 7:45.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not much to talk about here - we lunched at a Dairy Queen in Gallup New Mexico after passing through our first timezone.  There were many, many Native Americans there - the only non Native Americans were us and some old bitty behind the counter who took all her orders on a waitress pad then punched them into the register&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We started the day off again with a run through the Usery Recreational Area.  This time we knew where we were going, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t make it any less exciting.  We saw three hares (I believe that&amp;rsquo;s what they were) and a roadrunner.  Jenny was attacked by a cactus which waylaid us for a few minutes, but overall it was a nice run.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After spending several days with Quin, he seems to be getting smarter all the time!  No doubt it&amp;rsquo;s because of the extra exposure to me!!!  Anyway, I thought it would be a nice aside to go through some of Quin&amp;rsquo;s latest quotes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was nice to be somewhere that we didn&amp;rsquo;t have to be running all the time!  To celebrate, Jenny and I went for a run!!!  I had made it out in Denver for a quick 3 miler, but Jenny wanted to get out, so we went to the map and found somewhere that &amp;ldquo;looked like it had trails.&amp;rdquo;  After driving for about 10 minutes, we found a trailhead at the Usery Recreation Area and parked.  We didn&amp;rsquo;t have the $2 entrance fee for the self service registration, so we took all my dad&amp;rsquo;s change (we took his car), $1.45, put it in the envelope, and hoped for the best.  It was a nice run, but a word to the wise when running in the desert - if a trail has the word &amp;ldquo;wash&amp;rdquo; in it, don&amp;rsquo;t run on it!  We ran almost a mile on a trail called the Amigo Wash, which turns out to be a dried creek bed.  It was like running on a beach!!!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A 5PM afternoon nap of 90 minutes didn&amp;rsquo;t help us out here at all.  We tried to push him over to Grandpa and Grandma&amp;rsquo;s room right away, but he didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have much to do with that.  At one point Jenny and I were so mad at him that I took him out to the van to let him cry it out.  Eventually Jenny was able to take him over to breakfast and let Ethan and I sleep for a little while longer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Busy day, this one.  We woke up after &amp;ldquo;sleeping in&amp;rdquo; until 6:00 at the Hampton Inn in Flagstaff, AZ.  Very nice hotel, reasonably priced, with a nice rooms, decent continental breakfast, and most importantly, a POOL!!!  After Quin woke up, he and I went downstairs for some fruit, cereal, and juice.  Jenny and Ethan joined us shortly afterwards.  After we were sufficiently fed, we got into our swimming suits and took in some much deserved swimming.  We had the place to ourselves, which was nice since the kids are extremely loud!  I&amp;rsquo;d say we swam for at least an hour this way.  Ethan has become a very good swimmer and really enjoys the water.  He particularly likes when I launch him into flips, but we can only do that when nobody else is in the water.  Quin thinks that he can do anything that Ethan can do, but still can&amp;rsquo;t swim.  He really enjoys jumping from the edge of the pool into the water - not really jumping to me, but into the water.  I still catch him, though&amp;hellip;  He hates that!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;OK, I&amp;rsquo;m a little out of order.  Bear with me.  April 4, Easter Sunday, was a day of driving.  I was actually able to get out of bed and get out for a 3.4 mile run in the crisp Denver morning (41 degrees but sunny).  Running in Denver is nice and not so nice.  Nice because they have so many running trails and there are so many cute girls that are generally out exercising as well (even when it is cold).  Not so nice because it is the &amp;ldquo;Mile High City&amp;rdquo; and that seems to play tricks on either my mind or my lungs or both.  The first 10 minutes of this run was brutal!  After that, though, I settled into a nice, slow trod and was able to complete the run.  A couple of &amp;ldquo;interesting&amp;rdquo; things I saw on the run - there were a bunch of old men out walking their equally old looking toy dogs, there was a guy that lived in the city that had outfitted his little postage sized lot of land into looking like a farm, complete with 3 classic tractors that he appeared to enjoy working on, and there was this one spot on the trail where somebody had spread out a bunch of bird seed, no doubt meant for birds, but was being hoarded by a group of wayward squirrels that were afraid of nothing!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Holy crap it&amp;rsquo;s windy!!!  Short post for now. Jenny and Ethan are out looking at the little Colorado river gorge about 15 miles east of the south rim park of the grand canyon. It&amp;rsquo;s not too cold out but I bet the wind is gusting up to 50 mph. It&amp;rsquo;s so bad that it tipped over 2 portapotties.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quinny is napping. We left him in the car to start with but then felt guilty so now I&amp;rsquo;m hanging out with him. We are heading over to the main park in a couple of minutes and will post a full recount along with pictures later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve recently identified that I require an ipad in order to survive. In order to prepare myself I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to post my vacation blog entirely from my iPhone. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how long this lasts. I think I may be too old to learn to thumb type and ignore basic punctuation and spelling rules, but I suppose time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-trip-home&#34;&gt;The Trip Home&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At 6:30 we got up &amp;ldquo;officially.&amp;rdquo;  Jenny had packed the night before so we could maximize our sleep, but Quin had different ideas.  By 7:30 we were showered and ready to go.  A bellman picked us up at our room and took us to the &amp;ldquo;Common House&amp;rdquo; for checkout.  Here we were actually able to check our bags onto the airplane and get our boarding passes.  This Magical Express thing was really nice!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;morning-swim&#34;&gt;Morning Swim&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, our last day at the parks.  It&amp;rsquo;s been a pretty eventful week.  A bit tiring, but definitely memorable.  Today we had reservations at EPCOT early, 4:45, so we planned on spending the day there again.  There was a lot at this park that we haven&amp;rsquo;t yet done.  Also, mom and dad really like the world showcase, so there seemed plenty to do for the entire family.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We woke up late again today.  It was a bit of a rough night with Quin.  He had been very good all week up until, and for the most part including tonight.  This time, though, he was up a little bit in the night, not awake, but fussing.  It made it a bit difficult to get really good sleep.  Ethan didn&amp;rsquo;t have any troubles, though, which was all that really mattered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;late-start&#34;&gt;Late Start&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quin was up during the night and we were getting tired, so we slept in a little bit this morning.  Jenny and I got out for a run around the 1.4 mile running path that goes around the resort (we went twice around), we gave the kids baths, then we grabbed a leisurely breakfast at the Shutters food court at our resort.  It was a good jumping off point for the rest of the day, which we planned on spending at Animal Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Disney Day 3</title>

Rather than sleeping in and dealing with the crowds of people, we thought we&amp;rsquo;d leave a little early in hopes of getting on some more rides in less confined areas.  So we took off early for the bus (OK, I think we still got on the bus around 9:00) and headed for the Magic Kingdom.  If you&amp;rsquo;ve never been to Disney, the Magic Kingdom is one of those parks that you can spend days and days in, so our two half days really didn&amp;rsquo;t do it justice, but it would have to do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

My biggest worry coming to this resort with an infant was that he would be up and unconsolable in the night and he would wake people up.  Turns out I had nothing to worry about all along.  In fact, I would say that Quin probably slept better at the hotel than he does at home.  That is most likely because we were so close by and it was easy to get up to tend to him.  Either way, it worked out well and I had nothing to complain about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-note-on-these-posts&#34;&gt;A Note on These Posts&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m doing these posts a little out of sequence.  I&amp;rsquo;ve written notes as things happened, but I&amp;rsquo;m going back and filling in the blanks as I get time to write them.  At times it may seem a bit disjointed, so please forgive me.  The dates will be posted as though they occurred on the days in which the events actually occurred, however they will not be written or posted on those actual days.  Please adjust your expectations accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
