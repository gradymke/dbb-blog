      <description>I started this post almost a month ago, that&amp;rsquo;s how things are going! Life in COVID remains largely the same, but is starting to feel &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; in a lot of ways. Certainly there are things that we&amp;rsquo;d like to do, like go to the movies, or sit in a coffee shop, or have the whole family go to a basketball game, but in some ways, things are probably better. One thing we have been doing all along with varying degrees of success and consistentcy is to create new rituals to make things a little better.</description>
