      <description>&lt;p&gt;Parenting can be hard, obviously. And sometimes we (read I) don&amp;rsquo;t really live up to the challenge. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping this has happened to others&amp;hellip; The last time Mireille lost a tooth was in January. For Mireille, losing a tooth is a somewhat difficult exercise. For some reason, her teeth are very stubborn, and new teeth come up all over the place and don&amp;rsquo;t always displace the tooth they are supposed to replace! So for a few of her teeth, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried my dad-best to extract them, only to end up in tears (both of us, actually), and she&amp;rsquo;s had to go to the dentist to get them out. That&amp;rsquo;s what had happened in January the last time she lost one!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>COVID Reality - Day 2-9</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;COVID Reality Day 6 was the Grady&amp;rsquo;s breaking point. There was widespread dissent in the ranks, and those that are supposed to be even and get us through all this were SUPER crabby. Mireille had a big tantrum the likes that I haven&amp;rsquo;t seen in quite awhile, Quinton managed to squeek out some tears at some point, Ethan is cooped up and wants to see his friends and his girlfriend, and Jenny and I were basically not on speaking terms with one another most of the day. We were on yelling terms, just not speaking terms. Today seems to be better. The saving grace is that it&amp;rsquo;s very nice outside - spring weather makes everything seem a little better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>COVID Reality - Day 1</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today is the first day of what I&amp;rsquo;m calling &amp;ldquo;COVID Reality.&amp;rdquo; In Colorado, while we aren&amp;rsquo;t ordered to &amp;ldquo;shelter in place,&amp;rdquo; anything that would be worthwhile leaving the house for has been closed down, most notably all sporting events, theaters, churches, restaurants, breweries, and bars. Oh, and schools. These closures are setup right now for 4 weeks. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how long it actually ends up being (I doubt &lt;em&gt;shorter&lt;/em&gt; than 4 weeks). So we&amp;rsquo;re getting to know our family better, for better or worse. I&amp;rsquo;m working from home, the kids are doing school from home, Ethan is doing college from home (they closed the campus for the rest of the year), and Jenny has had to take on the new jobs of teacher and principal in addition to Janitor, Laundress, and overall house CEO.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Learning English</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mireille has been in the US for around 2 months now and by all accounts is doing&#xA;pretty well. One thing that we constantly worry about is whether she is picking&#xA;up English quickly enough. Of course we are on all these Facebook groups and&#xA;we constantly hear about how much English people&amp;rsquo;s kids are picking up and&#xA;Mireille has been a bit slow on that front. I tend to think many of those&#xA;people are embellishing their stories quite a bit, but whatever - she is a&#xA;strong willed girl and she&amp;rsquo;s going to speak Lingala, dammit!!!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
