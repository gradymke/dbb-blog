      <description>Yesterday, I had to mow my own lawn. Actually I wasn&amp;rsquo;t even that sad about that - it only takes about an hour to really do a number on my lawn. I do the mowing, of course, along with regular mower maintenance. Then I get the trimmer out and move the infringing grass back off of the cement walkways and what-not. Heck, I even took the time to fertilize. It was all done while I walked, contemplating what had just happened.</description>

      <description>Quinton started middle school this week. For some reason, middle school scares the hell out of me on behalf of my children. To boot, he&amp;rsquo;s been actively and heavily lobbying to be moved to the public school from our relatively more comfortable private school middle school situation. Well, he made pretty good arguments, so we relented, so now he has started school at Laredo Public Middle School, right next to where Ethan has spent his last 4 years at Smoky Hill.</description>

      <description>Last week it snowed in Denver for the first time this season. It&amp;rsquo;s a mixed bag out here for snow. People don&amp;rsquo;t really care for it in the city, like most places, but love when it happens in the mountains, where it is supposed to be. My kids certainly love it, at least the first snow.&#xA;Mireille has been saying &amp;ldquo;snow&amp;rsquo;s coming?&amp;rdquo; since about August when Jenny showed her some snow boots she could wear.</description>

      <description>Cars 2 is out! We&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting for awhile for this event as I had unofficially earmarked it as the first movie I would attempt to take Quinton to. I&amp;rsquo;m happy to report that there was nothing out of the ordinary that happened&amp;hellip; Yeah, boring blog post, but I&amp;rsquo;ll take it. I&amp;rsquo;d say he was as good as, if not a little better than Ethan when we took him to his first movie (I don&amp;rsquo;t recall which movie that was right now).</description>
