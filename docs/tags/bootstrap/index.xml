      <description>&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed something new when you browsed here today. No, I didn&amp;rsquo;t adopt another kid&amp;hellip; I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to shovel 12 inches of snow&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s a new theme for the website! I&amp;rsquo;m sure you are as excited as I am about the change&amp;hellip; Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter - this is my blog, and I can put whatever I want here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This theme is awhile in the making. I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing web development for probably 17 years (well, I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretending to do it for that long - much of that time has been dedicated to managing web developers, but let&amp;rsquo;s not split hairs), and in the time I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing it, it has changed mightily. In the early years, you had to do literally everything yourself. And in an environment that didn&amp;rsquo;t match up with many of the desktop or server environments (that being HTML/JavaScript/CSS), it wasn&amp;rsquo;t always pretty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
