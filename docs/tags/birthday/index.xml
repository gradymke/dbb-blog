      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;birthday-boy&#34;&gt;Birthday Boy&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;May 17th was Ethan&amp;rsquo;s 7th birthday.  To celebrate, we invited the boys from his class to join us at the YMCA for some cake, games, and swimming.  Unfortunately, Ethan has only 5 boys in his class, including himself.  Even more unfortunate, one of the boys didn&amp;rsquo;t show up, so there were only 4 boys there.  Actually, that ended up being lucky for us as boys are crazy!  The spent the bulk of their time wrestling and smashing into one another.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
