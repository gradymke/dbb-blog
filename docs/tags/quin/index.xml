      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mireille finally lost that first tooth! It was a few weeks ago, now. She was walking around the kitchen, and I asked her, like I had been every day for quite a few weeks, how her teeth were doing. Her two front teeth on the bottom were coming in behind the baby teeth. On that fateful night, one of them was finally loose enough that I felt confident enough to give it a little tug and evict it from its spot that the other tooth so badly wanted. She was tough - no crying or anything. I think she was a little sad that she didn&amp;rsquo;t lose it at school since they give you a cool necklace for your fallen chomper so you can take it home - she really wanted one of those necklaces!!! The other one never really got loose enough for me to pull, but the dentist did the deed a couple of weeks later with the help of some laughing gas and a little numbing medicine. I, sadly, wasn&amp;rsquo;t there to see it, but Jenny said she was pretty out of it. A little video would have been fun!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Big Man on Campus - a tall tale by Quinton</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quinton had an assignment to write a tall tale. Coincidental with getting the assignment, Quin had learned about a competition that his cousin, Graham, had recently done with his uncle, Bruce. For those that don&amp;rsquo;t know them, Graham is a 10 year old, not particularly big, and Bruce, his uncle, is about 5&amp;rsquo; 2&amp;quot; and weighs probably about 130 pounds. Anyway, Graham challenged uncle Bruce to a plank challenge. Bruce was able to plank for 5 minutes, but Graham was able to do it for 30 minutes! Inspired by this competition, Quinton decided to memorialize it in his very own tall tale.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quin loves pets. Ignore the fact that Heinz is our pet and he rarely is very nice to him. In fact, the nicest he typically is to him is when he ignores him. But if he finds a toad in the yard, or a stray bug on a window, he gets his ice cream pale, fills it with a little water and some leaves, and puts the poor thing in there until we force him to release the poor animal before they become a dead animal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-circumcision&#34;&gt;The Circumcision&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This weekend, my brother-in-law turned 50 and we were invited to his party. On the 30 minute drive to his house, Jenny and I were behaving like the good parents that we are and allowing the kids to listen to the Comedy Central channel on Sirius Satellite Radio, something of which we are currently enjoying a free trial. The content on the station isn&amp;rsquo;t all that, well, appropriate, but we count on the kids not listening much like they don&amp;rsquo;t listen to us - ever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago I got an e-mail from an old co-worker who still worked at my old place of employment. It was a complimentary e-mail, fairly light in nature, which made it all the more mysterious why the e-mail header on my iPad read, &amp;ldquo;To: Big, Fat, and Stupid - From: &amp;lt;name omitted&amp;gt;&amp;rdquo;. Hmm&amp;hellip; I asked him why that was what he had called me in his address book and he claimed innocense. I figured somebody at my old job was probably playing a funny joke by getting one of the IT guys to mess with my name on the company mail server.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Vacation - The Emergency</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Vacation just isn&amp;rsquo;t vacation until there&amp;rsquo;s a trip to the E.R. So today officially started our vacation!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This afternoon was pretty nice outside. It was around 60 degrees, not too much wind, so the kids went outside and played baseball. They were chasing the balls all around the property, including through some longer brush and what-not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a long day of playing, and a long night the night before, Quin was pretty tired. So around 7:30 we decided it was time to start what we thought would be a quick descent into sleepy time, starting with a bath. It was your typical bath, even though it was in a strange tub. Once he got out and was drying off, Quin was feeling around and discovered something strange on the underside of his &amp;ldquo;special purpose.&amp;rdquo; He showed it to me, and I confirmed - a tick!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the new year! With a new year comes a renewed hope that I will actually keep this thing up to date. Here goes this week&amp;rsquo;s attempt!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quin continues to grow up fast. Despite that, he still has the occasional accident at night where he wets his bed - and when he does, he wets it epically (his word). So we typically put him in a pull-up in the evening, which he takes like a good sport. A couple of mornings ago, I had just gotten done going for a run and was getting ready to take a shower. In our house, modesty is laughed at, so I was trekking from my bedroom to the bathroom, where Quin was using the toilet, without any clothing on. Since I had just gotten done running, I had the imprint of my elastic band shorts around my waist. Quin took a look at me, unfazed by the fact that I was completely nude, and gave me a concerned look. He pointed and said, &amp;ldquo;that hurts, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it!&amp;rdquo; I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what he was talking about, so I pressed him for details. He pointed at the imprint of my elastic band shorts and said, &amp;ldquo;there, where your pullup was. That hurts. I know!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t blogged in awhile. Part of it is sheer laziness. That compounds on itself in that there are just too many things to blog about so I just can&amp;rsquo;t find the time to get it done. I&amp;rsquo;m in that situation right now. But something happened a couple of weeks ago that was too funny not to document - so here goes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We went to Noah&amp;rsquo;s Ark - America&amp;rsquo;s Largest Waterpark - last week for a last ditch summer celebration. To set the tone (since I can&amp;rsquo;t tell a short story), I am building a deck, and had the guy coming out to auger the holes for the footings in the morning. My assumption was that he was going to be there for about an hour, from 8:00 until 9:00 or so, then we would leave after that. Well, that didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly happen as planned. He was there for almost 2.5 hours, and the fun vacation day to the Dells started out with one very angry wife.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;home-at-last&#34;&gt;Home at last!&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Strange way to start a blog about our vacation to Alabama, but I ended up not really writing during the vacation - something I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll regret in the end as I&amp;rsquo;m sure there is some level of excruciating detail that I will miss out on by not doing this in real time, but in the end I&amp;rsquo;m sure it will save you, dear reader, from the droning on that would undoubtedly result from a real-time, blow-by-blow that I would have otherwise forced you to endure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;adoption&#34;&gt;Adoption&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s all begun again. Jenny and I have started pursuing another adoption, this time an international one through the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire). So far much has been the same as last time around - filling out paperwork, background checks, talking about my feelings - fun stuff. We&amp;rsquo;re getting to the point where we will be having a social worker come to the house to interview us, so we were explaining to Quinton what we were doing. Jenny explained it to him that he was going to have a new brother. He looked very confused and concerned and asked her, &amp;ldquo;is Ethan leaving?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last weekend was the annual &amp;ldquo;Tri-ing for Children&amp;rsquo;s Triathlon,&amp;rdquo; a weekend long set of triathlons to benefit Children&amp;rsquo;s Hospital here in town. Jenny and I were both signed up to do the sprint triathlon, a 1/4 mile swim, 15 mile bike, then 3.1 mile run. We&amp;rsquo;ve done it a few years in a row now, so that&amp;rsquo;s not what I&amp;rsquo;m writing about - this year we decided to let our kids participate in the kid&amp;rsquo;s event on the Saturday prior to the adult races.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever heard the &amp;ldquo;Little Johnny&amp;rdquo; jokes? For several reasons, I have a feeling that they might one day be replaced by &amp;ldquo;Little Quinny&amp;rdquo; jokes. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of one - Little Johnny was in class learning his ABCs. The teacher was asking the class to name something with each letter of the alphabet in order. Little Johnny raised his hand for each letter, but she kept skipping him thinking that he would say something bad, like &amp;ldquo;ass&amp;rdquo; for A and &amp;ldquo;butt&amp;rdquo; for B. Finally, she had gotten all the way to R. Little Johnny dutifully raised his hand while nobody else did. She figured, &amp;ldquo;what could he say that is naughty that starts with R?&amp;rdquo; So she called on Little Johnny. Little Johnny immediately said, &amp;ldquo;Rats!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Oh, that&amp;rsquo;s nice,&amp;rdquo; the teacher said, relieved. &amp;ldquo;No, Rats, with big penises!&amp;rdquo; Little Johnny followed up immediately&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quin and I were at home together the other day - I can&amp;rsquo;t remember why. Jenny and Ethan were out somewhere, I think to get Ethan a haircut. We opened the garage and heard something flying around in there. Before long, Quin had spotted the culprit - a bird had gotten itself stuck in the garage. He was having a hard time finding his way out, and Quin was enthralled! I went into the house and started putting things away from my day&amp;rsquo;s work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We had the opportunity to travel to Spread Eagle, WI near Iron Mountain, MI for Memorial Day this year. A friend of ours works for a company that owns a &amp;ldquo;cabin&amp;rdquo; on a lake up there, which they allow their employees to rent by the week during the year. When say cabin, I mean a 5 bedroom, 4000 square foot, modern home that is situated on a lake up north. So we joined 3 other families up there for the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My boys really don&amp;rsquo;t think much, normally, before a Hallmark Holiday like Mother&amp;rsquo;s Day. Last night, however, Ethan asked me (discretely) what mom&amp;rsquo;s favorite breakfast was. I told him that she liked an egg over easy with toast. He nodded, then said that he&amp;rsquo;d like to make that for her in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So this morning, Quin (and I, I suppose) woke up a little after 6:00. He watched Garfield while I watched the inside of my eyelids for an hour more. Around 7:45, I heard Jenny stirring, watching TV in the bedroom. After another 15 minutes, I went upstairs to wake up my tweenager who had only 10 hours of sleep at that point, and told him it was time. He asked me what to do, and I told him. While Ethan was frying the egg, Quin made and buttered toast. Ethan got the egg just right on the first try, impressively! Quin then put a carnation in his teeth and carried the plate while Ethan poured some orange juice in a glass and delivered it to mom for mother&amp;rsquo;s day! I have no idea how it tasted, but Jenny ate it all up, so either it tasted fine, or she is just a good mom - I suppose it could be both&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-big-update&#34;&gt;The Big Update&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, for the prerequisite apology. My wife and my mother both have scolded me for not having an update out here for going on 2 months now, so here is the big update.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;quin-does-music&#34;&gt;Quin Does Music&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the last 2 months, Quin has put his musical skills on display. He enjoys listening to music on his CD player in his room - last night he told his babysitter all about the music player he had in his room with at least 10 CDs! He also told her that he had a really big bed. Something tells me that he is starting to develop his pickup lines early. Anyway, he loves listening to all kinds of music, but some of his favorites are &amp;ldquo;Sexy and I Know It&amp;rdquo; by LMFAO (he sings it &amp;ldquo;Sexxies and I Know It&amp;rdquo;) and &amp;ldquo;Moves Like Jagger&amp;rdquo; by Marroon 5, which Quin sings &amp;ldquo;Moves like Quinton.&amp;rdquo; His moves are not to be taken lightly. He very much enjoys doing &amp;ldquo;The Booty Dance&amp;rdquo; for us (sorry, I don&amp;rsquo;t have a video), particularly when Ethan is showing us some of his moves. More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s tough for me to write today because my favorite group of millionaires lost to somebody else&amp;rsquo;s favorite group of millionaires in a game I was sure would go my millionaire&amp;rsquo;s way. Oh well, we must persevere!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a typical busy couple of weeks. Today was one of Ethan&amp;rsquo;s last functions as a Cub Scout, the Pinewood Derby. For most kids this is an exciting event, but for Ethan and I, we sort of dread it. Neither Ethan or I really understand what it takes to build a &amp;ldquo;good car.&amp;rdquo; Our cars generally make it to the end of the track, but rarely very fast, and always much slower than most other cars. After the first year of innocence where we thought we could possibly achieve a place, we settled into the common goal of not finishing last. Last year we only achieved that goal by 1 or 2 places, and that was in the overall results, not just within our den! So it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too shocking this year when Ethan told me that he didn&amp;rsquo;t even want to make a car. Since I&amp;rsquo;m a den leader, though, I was bullied into pressuring him into making a car, so we did, but we did the barest minimum of work on it. No cuts, he wrapped it in a car wrapper purchased from the local hobby shop, we sanded and polished the axles and wheels like we&amp;rsquo;ve heard you should, and finally finished up the car on Saturday night. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t much to look at, but it at least went straight!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Neither Jenny nor I are very good about creating content for a baby book. In fact, I know I could not tell you where either of my children&amp;rsquo;s baby books are - perhaps in the top of our closet collecting dust. To capture memories, though, I&amp;rsquo;ve turned to this &amp;lsquo;blog. It worked out pretty well with Ethan so far, and Quinton has been no different. This post, then, is going to be some quick hitters to get into Quinton&amp;rsquo;s virtual baby book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cars 2 is out! We&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting for awhile for this event as I had unofficially earmarked it as the first movie I would attempt to take Quinton to. I&amp;rsquo;m happy to report that there was nothing out of the ordinary that happened&amp;hellip; Yeah, boring blog post, but I&amp;rsquo;ll take it. I&amp;rsquo;d say he was as good as, if not a little better than Ethan when we took him to his first movie (I don&amp;rsquo;t recall which movie that was right now).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The other day, Jenny wanted me to burn a DVD for her to give to a person at church. I told her no problem, grabbed a blank DVD which I promptly attempted to insert into my Mac superdrive. I was somewhat surprised to find that I could not put the DVD into the drive, however. The computer did not say there was anything in the drive&amp;hellip; Quite strange, I thought. I suppose that there could be a disc in there that the OS didn&amp;rsquo;t know about somehow, a computer glitch. So I went to &amp;ldquo;the Google&amp;rdquo; and researched how to force the Mac DVD drive to eject. Having found my solution, I executed it according to instructions. The drive whined and made that mechanical eject noise, but no DVD appeared.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;File this one under TMI (that&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;too much information&amp;rdquo; for those not in the know). I believe I&amp;rsquo;ve discussed how Quin and I have pee races in this blog in the past. On Friday I went on a field trip with Ethan, and to make a very long story much shorter, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much to drink during the day. When I got home, Quin wanted to have a pee race. While we were racing, I said, &amp;ldquo;wow, daddy&amp;rsquo;s pee smells bad&amp;rdquo; (I told you this was too much information - you had been warned). Quin leaned forward and sniffed and said, &amp;ldquo;Yeah, it does. You need a new penis daddy. A black one!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quinton has experimented with lots of different ways to express his anger with people when they don&amp;rsquo;t do things he likes. Initially he liked to call people &amp;ldquo;poopy butt,&amp;rdquo; but we quickly tried to squash that. He then moved on to calling people &amp;ldquo;stupid,&amp;rdquo; which I think I like worse than poopy-butt. Lately he has categorized you as either his friend or not his friend. If he likes you particularly, or if he wants something from you, he tells you, &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;re my best friend (he pronounces it fwond).&amp;rdquo; If, on the other hand, you tell him that he cannot have a candy bar after he hasn&amp;rsquo;t eaten his supper, he says, &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;re not my friend, Ethan&amp;rsquo;s my friend.&amp;rdquo; Of course, he will pick whoever else is around at the time, but you get the picture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>More Adventures with Potty Training</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So - potty training boys&amp;hellip; Yeah&amp;hellip; Well, we&amp;rsquo;re still doing pretty well, but something new has reared its ugly head. Now that Quin knows when he has to go to the bathroom, and no longer does it in his pants, he has decided that he wants to find other things to pee on other than the toilet. Jenny caught him peeing in the bathtub the other day. Yesterday I stopped him from going in the garbage can and in the refrigerator, while Jenny caught him trying to spray down the plunger in the bathroom. I have to admit, I didn&amp;rsquo;t see this one coming. Oh, the joys of raising boys!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Adventures in Potty Training - again</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Boy, a week makes a big difference. As of today, Quin is a week without diapers (while conscious). Last Saturday, Quin finally decided that he really, REALLY wanted to wear his light-up shoes all the time. He woke up on Saturday morning and told me, &amp;ldquo;daddy, I want my light-up shoes.&amp;rdquo; I told him that he had to wear underwear if he wanted to do that, and he thought that was OK. Since then, it&amp;rsquo;s been pretty much smooth sailing. Sure, he had a couple of minor slips the first couple of days, but overall it&amp;rsquo;s been outstanding! On Sunday morning when he woke up, Jenny went upstairs to find him sitting on the toilet &lt;em&gt;pinching a loaf&lt;/em&gt;, so to speak. In fact, most mornings now when he gets up, the first thing he does is strip down and put something else on so he can wear his light-up shoes. One night I caught him with his shoes in bed with him! It&amp;rsquo;s kind of nice that we really don&amp;rsquo;t need to do a lot of potty training, we just have to find a bribe worthy of our kids training themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I hate potty training. Jenny does, too, for the record. We&amp;rsquo;re no good at it. We rarely stay at home long enough to actually get our children into a rhythm of going every so often, we constantly forget to ask, and, well, it&amp;rsquo;s just pretty convenient to not have to worry about one of the four bladders in our posse at any given time of day. That said, we have (finally) started attempting some degree of potty training with Quin&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s not going so well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quinny and I played &amp;ldquo;monsters&amp;rdquo; tonight.  That little boy has quite an imagination.  First he pestered me until I came to &amp;ldquo;play me.&amp;rdquo;  So I followed him upstairs where he declared that he saw a monster.  For the next 30 minutes we were hiding, kicking, and even kissing the poor monster until his daddy put him to bed (both monsters).  Good times&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The other day we were at a party where we stayed pretty late.  On the way home, Ethan engaged us in interesting conversation, as always.  I can&amp;rsquo;t remember the exact context, but he asked something about somebody and if they were &amp;ldquo;a black.&amp;rdquo;  We told him that it was not appropriate to refer to somebody as &amp;ldquo;a black,&amp;rdquo; it could be insulting.  Instead he should use &amp;ldquo;black person,&amp;rdquo; or better yet, &amp;ldquo;African American.&amp;rdquo;  He took this in stride and continued on with his conversation.  After we got home, I was upstairs putting him to bed, when he asked me, &amp;ldquo;Dad, is it OK to call myself &amp;lsquo;a white?&amp;rsquo;  If I do that, am I insulting myself?&amp;rdquo;  I had to tell him that I honestly didn&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They call him baby driver.&amp;rdquo;  My dad used to sing that song to us when we were young.  I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I ever heard the real version, but I remember it almost as well as him saying &amp;ldquo;wake up and piss, the world&amp;rsquo;s on fire.&amp;rdquo;  Anyway, I digress&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a busy spring here at the Grady house.  So busy, in fact, that we really haven&amp;rsquo;t had time to do any yard work besides the required lawn cutting so far.  This past weekend, that was about to change.  The weather was nice, we were going to be home for a whole day after ditching on our original plans to be in Neillsville for the whole weekend, (we opted for an up and back on a single day trip instead), so the stage was set.  Jenny went out and bought some annual flowers to plant in the various places throughout the yard.  Ethan&amp;rsquo;s and my job was to obtain some mulch and fill in our weedy, mulch-bare flower beds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quin&amp;rsquo;s been quite the learner the last few months.  I think since our vacation in April he&amp;rsquo;s been picking up an average of a couple new words a day.  He has his favorites, though.  My latest favorites are &amp;ldquo;nan&amp;rdquo; which means &amp;ldquo;dance,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;nonut,&amp;rdquo; which means &amp;ldquo;donut.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quin has a definite love of dancing.  He has figured out how to turn on various CD players and radios throughout the house, and once they are on, he will come and grab one of us to come and &amp;ldquo;nan.&amp;rdquo;  Today he figured out how to turn on Jenny&amp;rsquo;s iPod and was &amp;ldquo;nan&amp;quot;ing to that.  Not surprisingly, he&amp;rsquo;s the best dancer in the house.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On this eve of &amp;ldquo;the closest thing the Irish have to Christmas,&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m sitting on my couch musing about my hopelessly silly kids.  Nature dictates that the oldest is silly like his dad, but nurture appears to have a strong influence on the youngest.  Too bad - we thought he had a chance!!!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We were out and about gathering materials for our latest home improvement project, built-in cabinets and a desk in our office (the wood floor was finished up two weeks ago).  After we finished getting some things at WalMart we came across some girl scouts selling cookies.  I have a soft spot for kids selling things, especially sweets, so I bought a box of Thanks-A-Lots (I think that makes 10 boxes this year).  Quin has a highly developed sweet tooth and immediately started saying one of his favorite words, &amp;ldquo;Cookie.&amp;rdquo;  We we opened up the box and all had one.  Not more than a minute later, Quin was again repeating &amp;ldquo;Cookie, cookie, cookie!&amp;rdquo;  Jenny thought he was palming it, or had just put it in his lap since very little time had passed and said to him, &amp;ldquo;no, you just had one.  Where is your cookie?&amp;rdquo;  Without missing a beat he leaned forward and opened his mouth and pointed to it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was traveling to Atlanta this past week, so Jenny and the boys were by themselves for three days!  It sounded like things were going pretty well, for the most part, until I was in the Hartfield Jackson Airport in Atlanta awaiting my boarding call to return home to Milwaukee.  That was when I received a call from Ethan.  &amp;ldquo;Dad,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;what do you do when Quin poops in the bathtub?&amp;rdquo;  You see, I am the poop cleaner in our house.  If it manages to get into a diaper or into the toilet, Jenny has no issue dealing with it.  If, on the other hand, it ends up somewhere outside the &amp;ldquo;norm,&amp;rdquo; that&amp;rsquo;s when dad the poopman steps in.  Unfortunately, the poopman was 700 miles away and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be back in time to take care of this situation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quin is starting to talk quite a bit.  I&amp;rsquo;m happy to say that he is finally speaking in sentences!  Of course, most, if not all of his sentences are just telling us no to different things that we want him to do.  &amp;ldquo;No ni-ni.&amp;rdquo;  &amp;ldquo;No eat.&amp;rdquo;  &amp;ldquo;No Bath!&amp;rdquo;  I guess you have to start somewhere!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other day, Ethan, Quin, and I were out to eat and had some time to burn before we went to swimming lessons, so we went to Best Buy.  We walked in past the DVDs.  I was looking at the Weeds Season 5 DVD with Marie Louise Parker on the front - Quin pointed at the cover and said, &amp;ldquo;Mommy!&amp;rdquo;  I thought that was pretty nice, because even though she&amp;rsquo;s older than Jenny, she&amp;rsquo;s quite good looking.  We then progressed further down the aisle when Quin picked out another movie where he pointed at Brad Pitt and said, &amp;ldquo;Daddy.&amp;rdquo;  Smart boy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year!  In the name of New Year&amp;rsquo;s Resolutions, I&amp;rsquo;ve resolved to blog on a more regular basis this year!  I&amp;rsquo;ve found that blogging is nice on several levels.  It allows people who care to follow along with what is going on with our lives (or ignore it, which is nice as well).  This is important right now since my parents have moved to Arizona for the remainder of this winter and will be grandchild starved for 3 months!  But more than that, it allows us to go back years later and see what we were doing now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Of course my wife reminded me of some things I forgot&amp;hellip;  If only she knew how to blog!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other day Ethan and I were driving to Soccer when we passed a section of road we frequently pass.  On one side of the road is a pretty steep, tree-covered hill with a couple of houses on top.  Ethan asked me, matter of factly, if the people living there were hillbillies.  To be honest, I was laughing to myself, but calmly collected myself before explaining that they were not hillbillies.  I was a little surprised that I was unable to come up with a really good description of a hillbilly without referencing Deliverance&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quin climbed out of his crib the other day.  We were working around the house and he was acting like he was tired.  He generally doesn&amp;rsquo;t like to take naps during the day, but we like him to take naps.  So I put him in his crib and began to let him &amp;ldquo;cry it out.&amp;rdquo;  I went outside to take care of something, and a couple of minutes later came back inside to find Quin standing downstairs, smiling at me.  He hasn&amp;rsquo;t done it since, but we now know it is possible&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I sat down to try to figure out the words he knew now and lost track.  He&amp;rsquo;s become much more interesting in the last month or so.  Anyway, a game that I always play with him is to push his nose and say &amp;ldquo;beep beep.&amp;rdquo;  Ethan might do it to him, too.  So now he goes around and pushes people&amp;rsquo;s noses and says &amp;ldquo;bee bee&amp;rdquo; just like we do&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

OK, they are second cousins once removed, or third cousins or something (you&amp;rsquo;d have to ask Blaine for the exact designation), so that&amp;rsquo;s probably OK in most You can tell they are from awhile ago as they were for Jodi&amp;rsquo;s baby shower - and they&amp;rsquo;ve already had the baby!!!

This year we went on the 3 day camp.  Camp started at 9:00 AM and went until 4:00 PM.  Besides the mosquitoes, it was a bona-fide blast for both of us.  Ethan was able to do all sorts of different activities, including archery (which is is very good at), mini-golf (which he is not so good at), highlander games, knight&amp;rsquo;s quest, etc.  For me, it was a good opportunity for me to see Ethan interact with other kids and adults and how he did in the different physical and social situations.  Let me tell you, if you ever find yourself annoyed at your child, spend some time with other people&amp;rsquo;s children - like 18 of them.  You will quickly appreciate your own!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Two weeks ago she suffered what appears to be a slipped disc in her back.  Her back legs quickly became disabled, and over the course of the next two weeks she lost control of her bladder and bowels.  She was almost nine years old.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The kids really loved her.  Quin probably moreso than Ethan, though she&amp;rsquo;s been a fixture in our house since Ethan has been around.  Quinton just loved her, despite the fact that he tried to kick her on occasion and pulled her hair, all of which she handled without complaint.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It was nice because I was able to control them with the remote control while I used my other hand to hold the bottle.  One of my favorite blogs is College Humor.  The video I happened to be watching that day was titled &amp;ldquo;Pot Cookie Monster&amp;rdquo; about a cookie monster like the one from Sesame Street but instead of regular cookies, he liked pot cookies&amp;hellip;  Here is the video&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

My first clue happened a couple of days ago.  We sat him in his high-chair to feed him and mixed all of the food onto his tray.  His tray does have segmented areas, but we generally just put stuff in the large middle one.  I think we put some chicken, apples, cheese, and crackers on the tray.  He finished up the apples and cheese pretty quickly as they are two of his favorite foods, but the crackers and chicken remained in the center.  I turned around to do something (I would claim that I was doing dishes, but my wife may call my lie out on that one), and when I turned back, all but a few of the crackers had been placed in one of the segmented partitions.  I watched in amazement as he sorted the remaining 2 or 3 crackers out from the chicken and the proceeded to eat the crackers one by one, all the while ignoring the chicken (he doesn&amp;rsquo;t like meat very much).  Some could argue that it is an early sign of OCD, but I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure it&amp;rsquo;s an early sign of pure genius!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As of last night, Quinton has become one of the walkers of the world. He took his first tenuous steps from Jenny to myself last night before bed. Everybody was very excited. Well, Ethan was a little disappointed since he was in the shower when it happened, but was excited nonetheless. Looks like it&amp;rsquo;s time to get the house to the next level of baby-proofness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another score for the &amp;ldquo;nurture&amp;rdquo; portion of the nature vs. nurture debate. Quinton walked when he was 11 months, 2 days old. Ethan first walked when he was 11 months, 0 days old. These results are not scientific by any means.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I hope you all had a wonderful 2008 and are ready to endure what is sure to be an interesting and trying 2009.  I have mailed a &amp;ldquo;2008 Year in Review&amp;rdquo; to some of you, those that I knew could take it (it&amp;rsquo;s a 30 minute video of our family).  If you would like one of your own and did not receive one, please e-mail me and I will be happy to send one out to you.  Now, on to the updates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;ethan&#34;&gt;Ethan&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We had Ethan&amp;rsquo;s parent-teacher conference yesterday.  He is doing very well in School, mostly thanks to Jenny.  She works with him constantly on his school work as well as reading, basic math and the like.  It&amp;rsquo;s a lot of work, but it is apparently paying off.  While in the conference we were able to read some of Ethan&amp;rsquo;s stories and reports that he&amp;rsquo;s been writing up.  I plan on posting a couple of them to this blog in the near future.  One of them which is hilarious is his essay on what he would do if he were president.  He is clearly a democrat in the making, let&amp;rsquo;s just put it that way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quin has learned the fine art of movement.  He still doesn&amp;rsquo;t really &amp;ldquo;crawl,&amp;rdquo; necessarily, but he lilts along like an army man.  Actually he looks a little like Igor would look if he crawled.  Since he&amp;rsquo;s been in motion, he&amp;rsquo;s bee quite happy and quite a handful.  I don&amp;rsquo;t remember if Ethan got into as much when he was younger, but Quin really likes to get into everything!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Quin&amp;rsquo;s also been sick for the last week or so.  He hasn&amp;rsquo;t really let it get him down, but his stomach has obviously not been feeling well for quite awhile.  That part is easy to remember from when Ethan was younger, unfortunately.  He hangs in there, though.  On the worst day, we had to change his clothes 4 times!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Poor kid&amp;hellip;  On October 2, 2008, we had our final court date at the Waukesha County Juvenile Court to finalize, legally, our adoption.  Largely it was uneventful, but it still managed to choke me up a little bit.  While there we met another family that was finalizing, except this was their THIRD adoption!  Crazy folks!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quin&amp;rsquo;s getting bigger and moving around more and more all the time.  Today, I&amp;rsquo;m proud to say, he said his first word that I could understand.  Jenny was telling me that daycare said that Quin had been saying &amp;ldquo;dada&amp;rdquo; lately.  When he heard her say that, he promptly said &amp;ldquo;dada&amp;rdquo; to us.  We&amp;rsquo;re working on &amp;ldquo;mama,&amp;rdquo; but hey, the kid knows what he likes!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I know that I&amp;rsquo;m getting  behind because my wife has told me that I&amp;rsquo;m in trouble because of how infrequently I blog.  I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know she knew I had a blog&amp;hellip;  Oh well&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quin&amp;rsquo;s doing great!  He&amp;rsquo;s 7 months old now and is quite mobile.  No, he still doesn&amp;rsquo;t (really) crawl, but has developed a rolling technique that enables him to get pretty much wherever he wants to go.  He&amp;rsquo;s also started to try out the &amp;ldquo;all fours&amp;rdquo; thing by getting up on his knees and lunching towards things that are slightly out of his reach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

That&amp;rsquo;s right, Quin&amp;rsquo;s first tooth has finally busted its way through his gums.  We were wondering why he&amp;rsquo;s been so crabby lately, and the old &amp;ldquo;well, he&amp;rsquo;s probably teething&amp;rdquo; excuse was wearing a little thin some 4 months later.  But lo and behold, it really was true this time!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here you can see him having a deep conversation with an old Elmo doll.  He seems a little skeptical I think&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He &amp;ldquo;fared&amp;rdquo; pretty well, though I&amp;rsquo;m not sure it was entirely his cup of tea just yet.  Ethan had a blast, at least for the most part.  We started out by getting a wrist band and going on the rides.  This is really the first year where Ethan was ready to go on the &amp;ldquo;big kids&amp;rdquo; rides.  Unfortunately we were there with Micky and her kids, and they aren&amp;rsquo;t quite ready.  Not to worry, we split up for an hour and allowed Ethan to go on several rides by himself, and he had a blast.  He even got to go on the bumper cars while I talked with a couple of Chicago guys waiting for their kids.  The only things he was not able to go on were the rides that had a 52 inch height limit.  Apparently he isn&amp;rsquo;t quite 50 inches yet.  Guess the NBA isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily in his future!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I ran in this event last year along with a team that we had assembled known as &amp;ldquo;Big Sky Multisport.&amp;rdquo;  We had our own jerseys and a whole bunch of people.  Ethan was so impressed when he came to watch!  He wanted to be &amp;ldquo;on my team.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This year we did it again, and they have a kid&amp;rsquo;s event.  So I ordered Ethan a jersey and he competed in the kid&amp;rsquo;s triathlon.  Well, it was actually a duathlon this year since we&amp;rsquo;ve had so much rain this summer that the lake where we swim is closed with algae problems&amp;hellip;  At any rate, Ethan is now offiially a Big Sky Multisport member.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In the past two weeks, Quin has been passing milestones by the handful and I have neglected to document them here, so here goes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago Friday, Quin passed not one, not two, but three milestones in a 12 hour period.  First, he ate rice cereal for the first time, and gobbled it up completely.  I mean, he really liked it!  Next, after his meal, Brett and I put him on the floor and he was observed for the first time rolling over (he had previously rolled over in bed two times, but this was the first time another human saw him).  To top off the act, Quin slept for 9.5 hours that night from 8:30 to 6:00!!!  That was the big one in my book!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m just sitting here doing some scout stuff and Quin is sitting right next to me in one of his bouncy chairs.  What&amp;rsquo;s different than normal is that he is grabbing &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; within reach.  He has access to a bunch of toys within reach and he is studying each one of them intently.  This is a first for him and quite exciting for us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It all started out innocently enough.  We were going to church on Sunday morning, after which Ethan was supposed to attend a birthday party for a girl in his class.  While in the &amp;ldquo;gathering place&amp;rdquo; after mass, Ethan was horsing around with a buddy of his when his head got bumped and one of his loose teeth started bleeding.  On came the waterworks!  He insisted that he was in no shape to go to the party.  We drove to where we were going to meet to discuss with hosts, one of who was a dentist no less, all the while Ethan was crying in the back seat.  Luckily for us, the party was postponed due to inclement weather.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We&amp;rsquo;ve had a good couple of weeks with him so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share with the lot of you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First off, he&amp;rsquo;s now eating about 5 ounces at a time every 4 hours.  Unfortunately, he&amp;rsquo;s still doing that at night as well.  Although, some nights he&amp;rsquo;s been known to go 6 or more hours between feedings, and when he does wake up to eat, he&amp;rsquo;s very good about going back to sleep promptly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-trip-home&#34;&gt;The Trip Home&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At 6:30 we got up &amp;ldquo;officially.&amp;rdquo;  Jenny had packed the night before so we could maximize our sleep, but Quin had different ideas.  By 7:30 we were showered and ready to go.  A bellman picked us up at our room and took us to the &amp;ldquo;Common House&amp;rdquo; for checkout.  Here we were actually able to check our bags onto the airplane and get our boarding passes.  This Magical Express thing was really nice!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;morning-swim&#34;&gt;Morning Swim&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, our last day at the parks.  It&amp;rsquo;s been a pretty eventful week.  A bit tiring, but definitely memorable.  Today we had reservations at EPCOT early, 4:45, so we planned on spending the day there again.  There was a lot at this park that we haven&amp;rsquo;t yet done.  Also, mom and dad really like the world showcase, so there seemed plenty to do for the entire family.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We woke up late again today.  It was a bit of a rough night with Quin.  He had been very good all week up until, and for the most part including tonight.  This time, though, he was up a little bit in the night, not awake, but fussing.  It made it a bit difficult to get really good sleep.  Ethan didn&amp;rsquo;t have any troubles, though, which was all that really mattered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;late-start&#34;&gt;Late Start&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quin was up during the night and we were getting tired, so we slept in a little bit this morning.  Jenny and I got out for a run around the 1.4 mile running path that goes around the resort (we went twice around), we gave the kids baths, then we grabbed a leisurely breakfast at the Shutters food court at our resort.  It was a good jumping off point for the rest of the day, which we planned on spending at Animal Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Rather than sleeping in and dealing with the crowds of people, we thought we&amp;rsquo;d leave a little early in hopes of getting on some more rides in less confined areas.  So we took off early for the bus (OK, I think we still got on the bus around 9:00) and headed for the Magic Kingdom.  If you&amp;rsquo;ve never been to Disney, the Magic Kingdom is one of those parks that you can spend days and days in, so our two half days really didn&amp;rsquo;t do it justice, but it would have to do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

My biggest worry coming to this resort with an infant was that he would be up and unconsolable in the night and he would wake people up.  Turns out I had nothing to worry about all along.  In fact, I would say that Quin probably slept better at the hotel than he does at home.  That is most likely because we were so close by and it was easy to get up to tend to him.  Either way, it worked out well and I had nothing to complain about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-note-on-these-posts&#34;&gt;A Note on These Posts&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m doing these posts a little out of sequence.  I&amp;rsquo;ve written notes as things happened, but I&amp;rsquo;m going back and filling in the blanks as I get time to write them.  At times it may seem a bit disjointed, so please forgive me.  The dates will be posted as though they occurred on the days in which the events actually occurred, however they will not be written or posted on those actual days.  Please adjust your expectations accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jenny has to work today and tomorrow, so I&amp;rsquo;m working from home.  So I got my laptop out, put on some slippers, and got ready for some good ole fashioned parenting.  I tell you, it really isn&amp;rsquo;t all that hard&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R-FisVNK-FI/AAAAAAAAADM/_tdNjy0h50I/s1600/QuinPics008-small.jpg&#34;&#xA;   height=400px &#xA;  &#xA;  /&gt;&#xA;  &lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;  &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;</description>

      <title>Pre Adoptive and a chink in the armor</title>

      <description>&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R9p2hOE88AI/AAAAAAAAADA/_sFiG--CP4I/s1600/IMG_3793.JPG&#34;&#xA;   height=400px &#xA;  &#xA;  /&gt;&#xA;  &lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;  &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s official as of Monday afternoon, we are a pre-adoptive family.  On Monday, both birth parents were given one last opportunity to choose to parent Quin.  The birth mother showed up and gave up her right to do so, and the birth father did not answer the attempts to contact him.  That&amp;rsquo;s an important step for us!  That means that there shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be any bad Lifetime movies written about our situation any time soon.  Now, we&amp;rsquo;re still not the official parents of Quin, still only the foster parents.  The adoption agency is now the legal guardian of Quin and all major medical decisions and travel plans must now be arranged through them.  We will also have three home visits from the agency to make sure things are going well.  After Quin has been with us for 6 months, the agency will file for a court date in Waukesha to make the adoption official.  At that time we will get a birth certificate and have the ability to apply for a social security number.  As you can guess, we&amp;rsquo;re very happy about this step.  It is a major one!  We feel very fortunate given all that could have happened.  Jenny was in contact with an adoptive family who had been selected only to have the birth parents change their minds just before the child was born.  I&amp;rsquo;ve also heard stories recently about people who were going through the legal risk period only to have the birth grandmother decide she was going to care for the child three days prior to the termination of parental rights hearing.  She went through the trouble of having her daughter declared unfit to parent so she became the legal guardian.  Needless to say, we feel very fortunate and blessed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Loose teeth and doctor&#39;s visits</title>

Almost like his golden birthday in days!  Jenny had to go in to work today, so Quin and I worked from home, and let me tell you, he does better work than some of the interns I&amp;rsquo;ve had!  I fed him once at 7:00, then he didn&amp;rsquo;t want to eat again until around noon (my mistake as I got lost in e-mails for awhile).  After that, he slept again until Jenny got him around 3:00, so like I said, he probably did more good (or less bad) than some of the interns I&amp;rsquo;ve had.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It was going to be later in the day, so we took Ethan out of school around 12:30 and headed over to the hospital. When we walked into the nursery, we were surprised to find two doctors circumcising Quin. We thought that had happened already in the morning!  Well, it was somewhat interesting to watch, but Ethan was not so impressed.  He asked me what was going on.  After telling him, he was officially appalled and decided he didn&amp;rsquo;t want to watch or be near that, so we went and found a TV for him to watch Zathura.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

OK, that will be his name assuming the whole adoption goes through, but since the birth mother has not named him, we will refer to him from here on out as &amp;ldquo;Quin.&amp;rdquo; Quin was born via a Caesarian section delivery in a Madison area hospital. He weighed 6 pounds 11 ounces and was 19 3/4 inches long. He has a pretty good head of straight black hair and brown eyes (so far as we can tell).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
