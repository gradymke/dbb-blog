      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jenny&amp;rsquo;s been looking at robot vacuum cleaners for awhile. Strangely, I&amp;rsquo;ve been against them. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what it was about them, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t think they would be able to handle our floors. Our first floor has a mixture of wood and high pile carpet along with rugs and the like - I just figured a robot vacuum would struggle.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then my brother bought one. Rocky, his robot&amp;rsquo;s name, is a fixture in his house now, and from what I can tell, is doing a serviceable job on his new hard floors! So I started to soften and do some research to see what the big deal was.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quinton has really wanted a remote control airplane for quite some time. Uncle&#xA;Blaine bought him a remote control helicopter a little over a year ago that&#xA;he absolutely loved for the entirety of the 10 minutes before he lost it in&#xA;the trees. Over the years he&amp;rsquo;s amassed quite the aresnal of cheap, crappy&#xA;remote control things - cars, trucks, motorcycles - each one cheaper and&#xA;crappier than the last. So when he continually asked for an airplane, I continually&#xA;managed to push him off.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
