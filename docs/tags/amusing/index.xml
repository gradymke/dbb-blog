      <description>Jenny was talking to Mireille on Sunday about things that girls talk about. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t privvy to the details of the entire conversation, because that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be appropriate - I&amp;rsquo;m a boy. One little nugget Jenny shared with me was when Mireille admitted to her, &amp;ldquo;I wish I was a unicorn. But I&amp;rsquo;m just Mireille&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
Then, yesterday, our little Unicorn proved she listens and absorbs way more than she ever lets on.</description>

      <description>Mireille has been in the US for right around 8 months now, and she still has yet to stop amazing me with how quickly she is adjusting. It&amp;rsquo;s not only just the English, though that is remarkable, but everything else as well. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can really explain it better than I can show it with the picture below which I believe encapsulates the completeness of Mireille&amp;rsquo;s Westernization.
  Westernized Mireille   Beyond device usage and creature comforts, Mireille continues to pickup English at an alarming rate.</description>

      <description>New words for the dictionary:
becept /bee * &amp;lsquo;cept/
Origin - from what I can tell, a combination of except and besides. Perfectly encapsulates the meaning of both in different situations.
Example: &amp;ldquo;Everyone is having fun becept me.&amp;rdquo;
w&amp;rsquo;bout /wuh * &amp;lsquo;bout/
Origin - shortened version of &amp;ldquo;what about.&amp;rdquo; Not particularly interesting for its meaning but rather it&amp;rsquo;s usage.
Example: &amp;ldquo;The moon doesn&amp;rsquo;t have it&amp;rsquo;s own light - it only reflects the sun&amp;rsquo;s light.</description>
