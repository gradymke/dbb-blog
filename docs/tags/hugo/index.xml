      <description>&lt;p&gt;I know, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t look any different. That&amp;rsquo;s sort of the beauty of this story. I&amp;rsquo;m going to warn you, if you normally come here for my amusing anecdotes about my kids, or perhaps to be regaled about my home improvement exploits, this story will probably seem somewhat dull. However, I owe this entry to the greater technological community, as there might be somebody, somewhere, that thinks even a little bit like me and are trying to do something similar to what I&amp;rsquo;m trying to do. And if they are a little like me, they will systematically hack their way through problems using Google, and maybe this article will show up and help them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re here, great! I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how you found it because I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet&#xA;linked the old blog to this one, nor have I done any advertisement or anything&#xA;(I probably won&amp;rsquo;t ever advertise).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There will be a larger series on how the new blog was constructed and some of&#xA;the technical ins and outs, but I wanted to quickly mention that the blog&#xA;is soft-launched, and today I added the ability to comment using&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://disqus.com/&#34;&gt;Discus&lt;/a&gt;, a SaaS based commenting and discuussion&#xA;platform. Please test it out and contact me with any problems you see. It&amp;rsquo;s sort&#xA;of &amp;ldquo;in beta&amp;rdquo; right now (not Disqus, but my usage of it).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
