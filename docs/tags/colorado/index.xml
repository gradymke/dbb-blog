      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-4&#34;&gt;Day 4&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today started out much the same as the last. I got up &amp;ldquo;early&amp;rdquo; and headed out for a quick run around the campus. The main difference today was that Ethan decided he would come with me! He&amp;rsquo;s training for soccer and was supposed to run 5 miles over the weekend. He decided that 3.2 at 9000 feet was a rough equivalent of 5 at 5280, which I&amp;rsquo;m inclined to agree with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-3&#34;&gt;Day 3&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Day three started out later than day 2. With nothing really pushing us out of bed, the room slept in. I got up &amp;ldquo;early&amp;rdquo; around 7:00 or so and circumnavigated the property on a &amp;ldquo;run&amp;rdquo; of sorts. Not sure you can really call it a run. Jogging occured, but a lot of walking also occurred. It was very brisk to start the day, at only 36 degF, and a bit of fog made it a little spooky, but it was good to get out and about and get the blood pumping earlyish. As part of my run I found the Heritage farm, a turn of the century farm that has been preserved and now they hold horse riding breakfasts there. There are also some llamas there. The nicest part was the view from Piano Prairie, though. Framed just right, you could almost imagine what it might look like if there were no roads or dwellings of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;day-2&#34;&gt;Day 2&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our first full day of vacation! Today is exciting because it will be most of our first time whitewater rafting. We were to be in Kremmling, about 45 miles away, by 8:30 for our half day whitewater rafting adventure. So we set an alarm for 6:30, which was fine with everybody considering we were all in bed &lt;strong&gt;early&lt;/strong&gt; the night before, got dressed, had breakfast at the cafeteria, and headed west on 40 to the bustling metropolis of Kremmling via Granby. Fortunately for Jenny, we quickly passed a Starbucks at a City Market in Granby so she was able to feed her addiction while in deep rural Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;prelude&#34;&gt;Prelude&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we first moved to Colorado two years ago, we made a point of being &amp;ldquo;tourists in our own state.&amp;rdquo; It seems so often that we live somewhere and never really get to experience it like somebody who visits. Life always seems to catch up with us. Lord Soccer demands attention, work, school, the house&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s a never ending cycle of demands on our time. So we&amp;rsquo;ve tried to keep it more fresh here in Colorado, since there is so much to see out here (despite there not being any measurable amount of recreational water anywhere out here).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Colorado Adventure Series - Crested Butte</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago, friends of ours from Wisconsin contacted us and asked if we wanted to spend some time with them in Crested Butte. They have a condo there that they were going to be visiting, and we decided it would be fun to check it out. I have to say, I&amp;rsquo;m glad we did.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Crested Butte is quite a long drive from our home. At about 4.5 hours, it&amp;rsquo;s by far the furthest we&amp;rsquo;ve traveled for this summer&amp;rsquo;s adventures, but we couldn&amp;rsquo;t pass up the opportunity to check it out. It was supposed to be a nice place with a good sized and under attended ski hill. So why not!??!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Family Hikes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last summer when we moved to CO, we weren&amp;rsquo;t very busy initially, so we took the opportunity to explore our great new state. This summer, after track has ended and we&amp;rsquo;ve buttoned up most of our backlog of home improvements, we have decided to do the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two weekends ago we went to Frisco for the weekend with Maylee and Steve. While there we stayed at a hotel, did a little shopping, visited three breweries (yeah), but the main event was a 20 mile bike ride, 10 miles each way between Frisco and Breckenridge. It was really a lot of fun, and the kids did really well, particularly Quinton who biked it all under his own power and didn&amp;rsquo;t complain a single time! Mireille was biking in her own way behind my bike, even peddling (the wrong way) from time to time. It was a lot of fun, but we were all very tired when we were done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Thanksgiving, Colorado Style</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our first major holiday in Colorado is my favorite of all holidays, Thanksgiving!&#xA;While it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to not be able to spend it with family, we were able to&#xA;make good memories of it by spending it in the Mountains at a ski resort. Hopefully&#xA;this is something we will make a tradition out of, because it was a lot of fun!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We went up on Wednesday and left a little early in hopes of beating the traffic&#xA;into the mountains. One thing you will hear from people that live in Colorado is&#xA;that going into the mountains, while awesome, is severely compromised by the&#xA;traffic on I70. At only 2 lanes for a long ways, many, MANY resorts to&#xA;service by that road, and unpredictable weather, it can be tricky to navigate.&#xA;We were lucky and made it up in the basic standard, about 90 minutes from our&#xA;house (maybe a little more, but it was in that general timeframe).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
