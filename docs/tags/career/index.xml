      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a minute&amp;hellip;
Today, Bryce introduced me to a friend of his that is planning an RV trip. Rather than just answering a bunch of questions, I pointed him to this blog, which caused me to go back and re-read it, which reminded me how much fun it was to have these things written down. So here we are.
Well, what&amp;rsquo;s happened&amp;hellip; Oh, I got laid off! Yeah, the great startup experiment didn&amp;rsquo;t go the way I had hoped.</description>

      <description>It doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen very often, thankfully, but I started a new job this month! It also doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen very often that I blog about myself. Both good things, I think!
At the beginning of February, I started a new job with Twilio. Headquartered in San Francisco, I&amp;rsquo;m actually working in Downtown Denver where one of the largest non-HQ offices is located. There are so many new things that I&amp;rsquo;m experiencing, which is sort of the point, I guess.</description>
