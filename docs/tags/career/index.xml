      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a minute&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today, Bryce introduced me to a friend of his that is planning an RV trip. Rather than just answering a bunch of questions, I pointed him to this blog, which caused me to go back and re-read it, which reminded me how much fun it was to have these things written down. So here we are.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, what&amp;rsquo;s happened&amp;hellip; Oh, I got laid off! Yeah, the great startup experiment didn&amp;rsquo;t go the way I had hoped. I mean, I really enjoyed working there, and the pace of work was a lot of fun and all, but the downturn in the market along with the introduction of &lt;a href=&#34;https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt&#34;&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/a&gt;, as well as ALL of the tech companies laying people off, combined for the perfect storm to mean that I got to experience my very first layoff from the &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; layed off perspective. I have to say, not a fan. Anyway, after 87 interviews with more than 20 companies, I finally landed at &lt;a href=&#34;https://tempo.io&#34;&gt;Tempo Software&lt;/a&gt; and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be happier. The product mix is really quite interesting to me - they deal in Agile planning and tracking tools, which are things that I really enjoy working with!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen very often, thankfully, but I started a new job this month! It also doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen very often that I blog about myself. Both good things, I think!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of February, I started a new job with Twilio. Headquartered in San Francisco, I&amp;rsquo;m actually working in Downtown Denver where one of the largest non-HQ offices is located. There are so many new things that I&amp;rsquo;m experiencing, which is sort of the point, I guess. For one, It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since I&amp;rsquo;ve worked at a company with more than 500 employees (Twilio has ~3000). Also, it&amp;rsquo;s been a LONG time since I&amp;rsquo;ve worked downtown anywhere, and the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve worked in downtown Denver. The obvious complication is commuting, which is something I&amp;rsquo;m still experimenting with. Denver is progressive enough to have a Light Rail system, which I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking advantage of. Jenny&amp;rsquo;s actually been kind enough to ferry me between the house and the light rail station a few miles from our house, so even two weeks in I can already feel my driving skills start to erode!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
