      <description>A big welcome to Heinz Doofenshmirtz Grady, our new puppy! Heinz comes to us from Little Buddies Rescue where he was dropped off from a puppy mill. We originally went there intending to adopt his sister, but she had already been spoken for by the time we got there. No worries! Heinz immediately endeared himself to us by fetching a toy for Ethan - a sure way to his heart!</description>
