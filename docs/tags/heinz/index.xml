Heinz comes to us from Little Buddies Rescue where he was dropped off from a puppy mill. We originally went there intending to adopt his sister, but she had already been spoken for by the time we got there. No worries! Heinz immediately endeared himself to us by fetching a toy for Ethan - a sure way to his heart! He had to stay at the rescue for a few more days so he could be neutered and have his initial vaccinations, so we went and picked him up yesterday. Unfortunately Ethan is up north spending some time with his grandparents, so he was not here to help us bring Heinz home. Quinton has been a lot of help, though! He was so impressed yesterday by the decrease in attention that he pooped his pants!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
