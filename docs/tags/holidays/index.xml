      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are many traditions that I&amp;rsquo;ve learned of since leaving the nest that my family was either ignorant to or just didn&amp;rsquo;t celebrate. One happened this morning, and has for the last 21 years of my marriage, yet I still forget to celebrate it - St. Nicholas&amp;rsquo;s Day. Jenny celebrated it year after year, yet I did not, so even though I&amp;rsquo;ve now been in my adult life much longer than I was ever in my parents&amp;rsquo; home, I still forget&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thanksgiving is literally my favorite holiday. I just love getting together with family and friends, cooking a delicious meal, eating said meal, just hanging out and napping with people. I think even more than Christmas, it is the most relaxing holiday out there!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This year, having already done the &amp;ldquo;Grady Christmas&amp;rdquo; several weeks earlier, our plan was to stay put for Thanksgiving. Luckily there are others in the greater Denver metropolitan area that are also too far away to spend the day with family, so they became our extended family for Thanksgiving. On the menu was the traditional Thanksgiving faire, turkey, rolls, potatoes and gravy, stuffing, scalloped corn, pie (lots of pie), macaronni and cheese, gouda roll-ups, bean dip - you know, the traditional stuff! One of the reasons I like hosting so much is because I get to keep the leftovers, so I planned ahead. For the nine people that were at our meal we cooked 28 pounds of turkey!!!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Thanksgiving, Colorado Style</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our first major holiday in Colorado is my favorite of all holidays, Thanksgiving!&#xA;While it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to not be able to spend it with family, we were able to&#xA;make good memories of it by spending it in the Mountains at a ski resort. Hopefully&#xA;this is something we will make a tradition out of, because it was a lot of fun!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We went up on Wednesday and left a little early in hopes of beating the traffic&#xA;into the mountains. One thing you will hear from people that live in Colorado is&#xA;that going into the mountains, while awesome, is severely compromised by the&#xA;traffic on I70. At only 2 lanes for a long ways, many, MANY resorts to&#xA;service by that road, and unpredictable weather, it can be tricky to navigate.&#xA;We were lucky and made it up in the basic standard, about 90 minutes from our&#xA;house (maybe a little more, but it was in that general timeframe).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
