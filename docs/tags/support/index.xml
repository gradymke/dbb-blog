      <description>I have been using the same external keyboard for my last three Macs, an excellent little Bluetooth keyboard from Logitech called the Logitech K810. It&amp;rsquo;s meant to be a keyboard for a Windows machine, but it works perfectly well for my Mac as well as my various iDevices.
This morning when I came in to start working for the day, I found the keyboard had lost its mind! None of the keys worked properly.</description>
