      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been using the same external keyboard for my last three Macs, an excellent little Bluetooth keyboard from Logitech called the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/bluetooth-illuminated-keyboard-k810&#34;&gt;Logitech K810&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s meant to be a keyboard for a Windows machine, but it works perfectly well for my Mac as well as my various iDevices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This morning when I came in to start working for the day, I found the keyboard had lost its mind! None of the keys worked properly. When I&amp;rsquo;d press Alt (which I have mapped to Command), it would turn the volume up. If I tried the Alt on the right side of the space bar, it would bring up the Print dialog. Things just weren&amp;rsquo;t quite right.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
