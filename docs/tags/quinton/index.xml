      <description>We live in Colorado. Our families, by and large, still dwell in places throughout the Midwest. Year after year this generates some degree of conflict, particularly when it comes time for celebrating the holidays. For this holiday season, we celebrated Grady Christmas on the ever traditional weekend of the first weekend of November. For the Tibbett holiday celebration, then, we coordinated an early January celebration. Actually, it was planned to coincide with my 45th birthday, because who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to travel to the frigid midwest to stay in remote, rural Wisconsin with his in-laws on their 45th birthday!</description>

      <description>There are many traditions that I&amp;rsquo;ve learned of since leaving the nest that my family was either ignorant to or just didn&amp;rsquo;t celebrate. One happened this morning, and has for the last 21 years of my marriage, yet I still forget to celebrate it - St. Nicholas&amp;rsquo;s Day. Jenny celebrated it year after year, yet I did not, so even though I&amp;rsquo;ve now been in my adult life much longer than I was ever in my parents&amp;rsquo; home, I still forget&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>This was a couple of weeks ago now, so it&amp;rsquo;s not as fresh in my mind as it was when it happened, but the event was important enough that I think it warrants documentation. You see, this was Mireille&amp;rsquo;s fifth birthday, her second in the United States.
For the weeks leading up to September 9, Mireille has been asking on a regular basis about her birthday party. She really wanted to have a party, with a bounce castle, and a cake, and presents!</description>

      <description>Summer is finally upon us. Last week was a full week without school, except for Mireille, but that&amp;rsquo;s daycare - even though she calls it school. The temperatures as of last Thursday definitely represented a shift into the ungodly hot area, though in Denver, if you can find shade, you are in good shape since the humidity is very comfortable. As a family we are definitely settling in more and more as the years have gone by.</description>

      <description>As is typical now a days, I find myself delinquent in my posting. I blame my new job. Nothing more. Oh, and having three kids is hard. Not sure I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned that. Still, they keep us on our toes, and I occasionally remember to write some of the remarkable things down that they do. The following is a small collection of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve remembered.
Mireille &amp;hellip;on language&amp;hellip; Mireille&amp;rsquo;s pronoun usage continues to improve, though her favorite pronoun continues to be &amp;ldquo;him.</description>

      <description>I can remember one year when we did the traditional &amp;ldquo;Holiday Letter.&amp;rdquo; It was the year that we were in the process of trying to adopt Quinton, so we were &amp;ldquo;marketing ourselves&amp;rdquo; to our family and friends that year. Looking back, it was a fun letter to do, even if it was not necessary from the salesman side of house. I thought it would be fun to condense 2016 into a bit of a letter to our family (thank you both of my readers) and so that future versions of ourselves might enjoy reading it as well.</description>

      <title>The First Snow of the Year</title>

      <description>Last week it snowed in Denver for the first time this season. It&amp;rsquo;s a mixed bag out here for snow. People don&amp;rsquo;t really care for it in the city, like most places, but love when it happens in the mountains, where it is supposed to be. My kids certainly love it, at least the first snow.
Mireille has been saying &amp;ldquo;snow&amp;rsquo;s coming?&amp;rdquo; since about August when Jenny showed her some snow boots she could wear.</description>

      <description>Quinton loves his iPad, and he loves video games. Those are his leisure time activities, which is a funny thing to say, leisure time for an 8 year old! What he really loves to do is to enjoy both of them at the same time, which is something we try to limit for various reasons. It also presents itself as an opportunity for us when dolling out discipline.
Last week, Quinton had some egregious issue for which he had to be punished.</description>

      <description>After five days of adult vacation in New Orleans, Jenny and I were happy to be back with our kids, and probably a bit surprised that five days wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite enough to really decompress! Things went back to normal very quickly.
Mirielle gas been constantly about three things - now, trick or treating, and the party that she was going to yesterday. The snow things is pretty funny. I seem to remember her not liking it very much when it showed up last spring, but just about every day she will ask us, very seriously, &amp;ldquo;snow coming?</description>

      <title>Quinton&#39;s Last Track Meet</title>

      <description>Quinton joined the Aurora Recreational Track Team this summer. We were excited about this particular activity because it would be something Quinton couldn&amp;rsquo;t just partially do. We find that, often times during soccer or basketball, Quinton is perfectly content to move at about half pace. He is bigger and faster than most of the kids he plays against in those sports, so if he plays about half way, he can still be competitive but not sweat too much.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s 9:44 PM on Thursday evening. I&amp;rsquo;ve finally settled down to my computer and a bomber of my local&amp;rsquo;s double IPA. It&amp;rsquo;s the first time today that I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to sit without somebody demanding something or me having to be preparing something for somebody. You see, Jenny has been traveling for work since Monday morning, leaving me, a single father of three.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been a single father in the past.</description>

      <description>Last weekend we had to opportunity to go to the African-Caribbean Heritage Camp. It is one of a set of camps put on by an organization in town here that focuses on transracially formed families, specifically formed through adoption. Yeah, they have organizations for everything! We had been to the camp once before, two years ago, and enjoyed it so much that we decided to move to Denver!
Over the course of the two and a half days of camp we were all immersed with people in a very similar situation to our family.</description>

      <description>For some reason, Quinton has decided lately that he wants to be an actor. He feels he could be rich, and feels that he&amp;rsquo;s every bit as good as the people he&amp;rsquo;s seen on TV and movies.
Yesterday on our trip back from Colorado Springs where we were watching soccer, Quinton was going into great detail about what would happen when he&amp;rsquo;s an actor. First I told him that he&amp;rsquo;d probably need to hire an agent.</description>

      <description>8 years ago yesterday, we were given a call that Quinton&amp;rsquo;s birth mother was going into labor. By 10:30 AM on this morning, 8 years ago, Quinton was born!
It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe that it&amp;rsquo;s been 8 years. Looking back on the pictures, so much has happened. He has grown so much, made us laugh, made us cry, asked so many important questions, and taught us things we never thought we even needed to know.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I posted about Quinton&amp;rsquo;s recent obsession with Football in a prior post or two. If not, let me just say that Quinton has fallen HARD for football and all things about it. It&amp;rsquo;s to the point where he will actually put down his iPad (gasp) and ask me to turn on a football game when he knows one will be on. If you know Quinton, you know that is not something to take lightly.</description>

      <description>Most days are pretty much the same. I get up at 5:30, shower, get Ethan up at 6:00, make breakfast for us, then leave around 6:30 to get him to School. After that I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what typically happens as Jenny just takes care of it. Well, last week I had the opportunity to walk Quinton to school because Ethan had final exams and would be getting done around the time Quinton would normally be going to school.</description>

      <description>Our first major holiday in Colorado is my favorite of all holidays, Thanksgiving! While it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to not be able to spend it with family, we were able to make good memories of it by spending it in the Mountains at a ski resort. Hopefully this is something we will make a tradition out of, because it was a lot of fun!
We went up on Wednesday and left a little early in hopes of beating the traffic into the mountains.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re redoing our kitchen right now. I have a long post queued up for some time in the near future to go through some of the experience and show pictures. It&amp;rsquo;s been fun, but it&amp;rsquo;s also been interesting.
Last weekend we finally got to the point where we could take out our old lower cabinets and replace them with the new ones. The plan was to demolish on Saturday and install on Sunday.</description>

      <description>Jenny had Quinton write a letter to Santa. Since he was also typing a thank you letter to his grandparents on my e-mail, he decided to e-mail his letter to Santa this year. I came across it in my drafts folder and found it amusing.

      <description>New words for the dictionary:
becept /bee * &amp;lsquo;cept/
Origin - from what I can tell, a combination of except and besides. Perfectly encapsulates the meaning of both in different situations.
Example: &amp;ldquo;Everyone is having fun becept me.&amp;rdquo;
w&amp;rsquo;bout /wuh * &amp;lsquo;bout/
Origin - shortened version of &amp;ldquo;what about.&amp;rdquo; Not particularly interesting for its meaning but rather it&amp;rsquo;s usage.
Example: &amp;ldquo;The moon doesn&amp;rsquo;t have it&amp;rsquo;s own light - it only reflects the sun&amp;rsquo;s light.</description>

      <description>Quinton has really wanted a remote control airplane for quite some time. Uncle Blaine bought him a remote control helicopter a little over a year ago that he absolutely loved for the entirety of the 10 minutes before he lost it in the trees. Over the years he&amp;rsquo;s amassed quite the aresnal of cheap, crappy remote control things - cars, trucks, motorcycles - each one cheaper and crappier than the last.</description>
