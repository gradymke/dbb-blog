Almost like his golden birthday in days!  Jenny had to go in to work today, so Quin and I worked from home, and let me tell you, he does better work than some of the interns I&amp;rsquo;ve had!  I fed him once at 7:00, then he didn&amp;rsquo;t want to eat again until around noon (my mistake as I got lost in e-mails for awhile).  After that, he slept again until Jenny got him around 3:00, so like I said, he probably did more good (or less bad) than some of the interns I&amp;rsquo;ve had.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
