      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the vast majority of this blog&amp;rsquo;s audience (Hi mom and dad!), you probably don&amp;rsquo;t know much about the Youtube generation and what types of things go on here. I can&amp;rsquo;t say I know much more outside of what I observe from my children as they are interacting with these sites, but let me try to explain. In today&amp;rsquo;s day and age, being a &amp;ldquo;Youtuber&amp;rdquo; is an actual profession that people aspire towards. There are some &amp;ldquo;internet famous&amp;rdquo; people that actually make not only a living, but millions of dollars a year just posting videos on Youtube. Some notable ones are PewDiePie and Rhett and Link, among others. Basically they post various things to Youtube, ranging from just recording themselves doing something mundane like playing video games, to full on productions in an almost talk show format, sort of like a more interactive PeeWee&amp;rsquo;s Playhouse.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
