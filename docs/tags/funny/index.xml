      <title>Naughty</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Apparently all my kids are naughty! In the online world, dealing with bullies and hate speech is constantly a topic. It&amp;rsquo;s very easy in an anonymized world to pop off to people in ways that you might not if you were in the same room. Quinton has shown us that for years, though he was pretty inventive about it. At one point, I think he had 5 or 6 different free email addresses that he would use to sign back up for services that he got banned from because he was bullying or harassing people. I never in my life thought that my demure, perfect little daughter would be up to the same shenanigans&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Best Mother So Far</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the best parts of being a parent, in my estimation, is watching my kids&amp;rsquo; sense of humor develop. Early on, it&amp;rsquo;s at once fun and annoying to watch them try new things out and see what type of reaction they get. The annoying part comes with things like the constant use of the word &amp;ldquo;diarhea&amp;rdquo; that Mireille currently thinks is funny. The fun part, though, is seeing Ethan tell his grandmother, who had recently burst a blood vessel in her eye, that she could potentially remediate it with a quick trip to the Halloween Store.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Weakest Part of Every System...</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the movies it is popular to portray computer hackers as these happy-go-lucky nerds who are mainly interested in whether they &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do something rather than whether than &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; do something. In the movies they typically get in over their head, or go up against a rival hacker gang and&amp;hellip; get in over their head.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the real world, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to say that computer hackers are the same as the way they are portraid in the movies - at least the movies I remember. Sure, they are smart folks. But more often than not, at least for the vast majority of the hacking attempts, they are looking to exploit people to get access to their personal information so they can sell it to another bad actor who will then try to profit from having that information. Oh, and &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of the time, hackers are targeting the weakest part of every system - human beings!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Parenting can be hard, obviously. And sometimes we (read I) don&amp;rsquo;t really live up to the challenge. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping this has happened to others&amp;hellip; The last time Mireille lost a tooth was in January. For Mireille, losing a tooth is a somewhat difficult exercise. For some reason, her teeth are very stubborn, and new teeth come up all over the place and don&amp;rsquo;t always displace the tooth they are supposed to replace! So for a few of her teeth, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried my dad-best to extract them, only to end up in tears (both of us, actually), and she&amp;rsquo;s had to go to the dentist to get them out. That&amp;rsquo;s what had happened in January the last time she lost one!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sex... Explained...</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past several nights, in the midst of our Corona Quarantine, Quinton and I have started watching the show Locke and Key on Netflix together. It&amp;rsquo;s a nice time for the two of us to hang out, watch a pretty well done, suspenseful show together, and have some interesting banter and conversation as a matter of course.  Last night, the episode was a little shorter than normal, and to be honest, our sleeping routines are starting to trend later on either end of the sleep equation, so after our episode was done, the next thing Netflix recommended for me to watch was a show called Sex Explained. Quinton looked at me with a little grin&amp;hellip; Being the designated sex educator in the family, I made a command decision that it would be a fine thing for him to watch, though I hadn&amp;rsquo;t watched it myself, so I had no idea what the content might be like. It was rated TV-MA (which Quinton still pronounces TV &amp;ldquo;mah&amp;rdquo;) afterall.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Dead Cat Saga</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of weekends ago, Quinton and I, on a whim, went outside to play catch with a baseball. It&amp;rsquo;s sort of odd that we would do that. Most of Quin&amp;rsquo;s time at home involves playing XBox, and most of my time involves yelling at Quinton about playing XBox, but on this occassion we both decided to do something a little different.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Flash back to earlier that morning, upon waking up I saw that our doorbell camera had gone off a couple of times during the night. I studied the pictures (since I&amp;rsquo;m too cheap to pay for video storage) to find a cat hanging around on our front stoop. Kind of strange, but whatever. Later that morning I took something out to the garbage and, upon rounding the corner to the front of the house, I was presented with some kind of bad smell. I chalked it up to needing the garbage taken away and went about my day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Quin Said a Bad Word</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s graduation week. I have a longer, more sentimental post that I&amp;rsquo;m working through, but I had to jot this one down quickly before it was lost to history. Since it is graduation week, we have family that have started arriving to help Ethan celebrate and to help remind us how old we are.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last night, my parents, Ethan and his girlfriend Rachel, and Jenny and I were sitting around the table just talking about different things. It was nice. Quinton was in his room playing XBox and Mireille was kind of bouncing between the TV in the living room and upstairs. At one point, though, she came in and talked with all of us to ensure that she could tattle on her brother.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find my toothbrush this morning. That may not sound that strange, but I have one of those big Sonicare toothbrushes that would seem very difficult to lose. In fact, where my toothbrush was supposed to be, Jenny&amp;rsquo;s had taken its place, a similar Sonicare but different color.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had no idea where it could be. Initially I blamed Jenny for hiding it on me. She came home angry last night for reasons unknown, and was argumentative. Since I had brushed my teeth before she had gotten home, I immediately blamed her for hiding my toothbrush out of spite. However, she explained that she did not hide it, and I eventually believed her sincerity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Miscellaneous Catching Up</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been awhile on a couple of these, so I figured I should jot them down before time erodes them from my memory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This first story has been getting good traction in my friend and colleague circles. Before I can tell the story, I need to tee it up a little bit. Quinton is obviously a black male being raised among “the whites.” From time to time that causes some conflict in him. He really likes the idea of exploring black culture, but acknowledges that he doesn’t know much about it. One thing he likes to do to try to dip his toe into it is to listen to rap music. While there is a very deep collection of amazing rap songs, many, many of them delve into topics or language that is just a little rough to continually barrage the ears of our five year old, and ten year old as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The First Snow of the Year</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week it snowed in Denver for the first time this season. It&amp;rsquo;s a mixed bag out here for snow. People don&amp;rsquo;t really care for it in the city, like most places, but love when it happens in the mountains, where it is supposed to be. My kids certainly love it, at least the first snow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mireille has been saying &amp;ldquo;snow&amp;rsquo;s coming?&amp;rdquo; since about August when Jenny showed her some snow boots she could wear. When it finally snowed last week, I picked her up from school and the first thing she said was &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s snowing!&amp;rdquo; As soon as we got home, she wormed her way into her snow pants, coat, boots, hat, and gloves and demanded that I come outside with her so she could play in the snow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Bloggable Offense</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quinton loves his iPad, and he loves video games. Those are his leisure time activities, which is a funny thing to say, leisure time for an 8 year old! What he really loves to do is to enjoy both of them at the same time, which is something we try to limit for various reasons. It also presents itself as an opportunity for us when dolling out discipline.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Quinton had some egregious issue for which he had to be punished. The worst thing we can do to him is to take away his iPad. Since this escalated, we had to not only take away his iPad, but also limit video games for the weekend. Because he is stubborn he still managed to get his iPad from time to time, so I took additional measures to actually take away his network access, which I can do from the wireless router. This was effective, for a time&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mireille&amp;rsquo;s been home with us for two weeks today. Many of you are probably&#xA;looking for some post that goes through that in some detail. This is not that&#xA;post. I&amp;rsquo;m working up a larger post, but interestingly, going from two to three&#xA;kids, and having that new kid be 3.5 years old, well, it changes how you can&#xA;spend your time. Ah, material for another post. This post deals with an&#xA;acute familial incident that happened to involve the entire family in one way&#xA;or another&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I posted about Quinton&amp;rsquo;s recent obsession with Football in a&#xA;prior post or two. If not, let me just say that Quinton has fallen HARD for&#xA;football and all things about it. It&amp;rsquo;s to the point where he will actually put&#xA;down his iPad (gasp) and ask me to turn on a football game when he knows one&#xA;will be on. If you know Quinton, you know that is not something to take&#xA;lightly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Most days are pretty much the same. I get up at 5:30, shower, get Ethan up at&#xA;6:00, make breakfast for us, then leave around 6:30 to get him to School. After&#xA;that I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what typically happens as Jenny just takes care of it. Well,&#xA;last week I had the opportunity to walk Quinton to school because Ethan had&#xA;final exams and would be getting done around the time Quinton would normally&#xA;be going to school.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are first year Coloradoans, so we are behaving like them. We purchased&#xA;season ski passes, even though it is next to impossible to get into the&#xA;mountains due to all the traffic. We are in the process of upgrading all of our&#xA;equipment because no Coloradoan would be caught dead with the 10 year old&#xA;skis that we have!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since we are planning on going to the mountains for our first trip over&#xA;Thanksgiving, we needed to get some equipment for Quinton and Ethan. Luckily,&#xA;they bend over backwards in Colroado to hook your kids on the whole mountain&#xA;experience. So they have all sorts of deals on equipment. For Quinton, who&#xA;wants to snowboard, it costs $109 to purchase a bunch of used stuff for the year,&#xA;then you can sell it back to them next season for $55 and put that towards&#xA;a new setup. Great theory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re redoing our kitchen right now. I have a long post queued up for some time&#xA;in the near future to go through some of the experience and show pictures. It&amp;rsquo;s&#xA;been fun, but it&amp;rsquo;s also been interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last weekend we finally got to the point where we could take out our old&#xA;lower cabinets and replace them with the new ones. The plan was to demolish&#xA;on Saturday and install on Sunday. For the most part this went off without&#xA;a hitch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jenny had Quinton write a letter to Santa. Since he was also typing a thank&#xA;you letter to his grandparents on my e-mail, he decided to e-mail his letter&#xA;to Santa this year. I came across it in my drafts folder and found it amusing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;dear santa i want a ps vita a dirt bike a soccer ball a trampoline football&#xA;gear mostly a dirt bike and a ps vita and halo 5 and ps 4 and 100 dollars and&#xA;a golden retreiver.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
