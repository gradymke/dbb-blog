      <description>Today we parted ways with our furry friends Zazu and Odin (or as Mireille would spell it, Oddainn - I don&amp;rsquo;t know why). They were fun little pets that kept me company while I worked with their squeals, foot falls, and very much so their smell&amp;hellip;
Zazu joined us I think 5 years ago already. Quinton really wanted a pet - he wanted a dog. We convinced him that a guinea pig would be better.</description>

      <description>We added a new family member this weekend.
Zaz and Quinton Say hello to &amp;ldquo;Zazu,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Zaz&amp;rdquo; as Quinton likes to call him. Quinton has really wanted a pet of his own for awhile now. He has been trying to get us to get another dog and for me to leave the dog alone so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be the &amp;ldquo;alpha male&amp;rdquo; to this one like I am to Heinz.
So this weekend he talked us into allowing us to use some of his Christmas money from Grandma and Grandpa to buy a Guinea Pig and the accessories needed for it.</description>
