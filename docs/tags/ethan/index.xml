      <title>Christmas with the Tibbetts</title>

      <description>We live in Colorado. Our families, by and large, still dwell in places throughout the Midwest. Year after year this generates some degree of conflict, particularly when it comes time for celebrating the holidays. For this holiday season, we celebrated Grady Christmas on the ever traditional weekend of the first weekend of November. For the Tibbett holiday celebration, then, we coordinated an early January celebration. Actually, it was planned to coincide with my 45th birthday, because who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to travel to the frigid midwest to stay in remote, rural Wisconsin with his in-laws on their 45th birthday!</description>

      <description>This was a couple of weeks ago now, so it&amp;rsquo;s not as fresh in my mind as it was when it happened, but the event was important enough that I think it warrants documentation. You see, this was Mireille&amp;rsquo;s fifth birthday, her second in the United States.
For the weeks leading up to September 9, Mireille has been asking on a regular basis about her birthday party. She really wanted to have a party, with a bounce castle, and a cake, and presents!</description>

      <description>As of Monday, June 26, the world has a new driver. Ethan passed his driver&amp;rsquo;s test last Friday and made it official with the DMV (and our insurance agent) on Monday. It was actually a nice thing today. It&amp;rsquo;s Bike to Work day here in Denver, so I rode my bike in. About 2 miles from home, one of my tires popped, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a repair kit with me.</description>

      <description>Summer is finally upon us. Last week was a full week without school, except for Mireille, but that&amp;rsquo;s daycare - even though she calls it school. The temperatures as of last Thursday definitely represented a shift into the ungodly hot area, though in Denver, if you can find shade, you are in good shape since the humidity is very comfortable. As a family we are definitely settling in more and more as the years have gone by.</description>

      <title>2016 - The Year in Review - First Trimester</title>

      <description>I can remember one year when we did the traditional &amp;ldquo;Holiday Letter.&amp;rdquo; It was the year that we were in the process of trying to adopt Quinton, so we were &amp;ldquo;marketing ourselves&amp;rdquo; to our family and friends that year. Looking back, it was a fun letter to do, even if it was not necessary from the salesman side of house. I thought it would be fun to condense 2016 into a bit of a letter to our family (thank you both of my readers) and so that future versions of ourselves might enjoy reading it as well.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s fun having somebody to drive you around, I&amp;rsquo;m finding. Since getting his permit, Ethan has logged a little over 5 hours of driving of the 50 that he needs to log by June next year in order to obtain his driver&amp;rsquo;s license. When he started driving, and after seeing the number of hours he would have to drive, I told him that there were over 300 breweries in Colorado, and the way he was going to learn how to drive was to take me to as many of them as he could&amp;hellip; Last night he told me that it was time to drive, and that I should grab my Pub Pass and we would stop for a beer somewhere.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s not often that I blog about our oldest son, Ethan. He&amp;rsquo;s not cute and little anymore. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t say stupid things innocently so that I can have poignant teaching moments with him&amp;hellip; Well, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t do that as often, and he would probably take exception to me announcing them to the world now that he&amp;rsquo;s all social media savvy and all.
Ethan has grown into quite the young man. Though he is only 15, he has already learned many of life&amp;rsquo;s most important lessons, mainly the ones about treating others as you would want to be treated - he excels at that.</description>

      <description>Our first major holiday in Colorado is my favorite of all holidays, Thanksgiving! While it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to not be able to spend it with family, we were able to make good memories of it by spending it in the Mountains at a ski resort. Hopefully this is something we will make a tradition out of, because it was a lot of fun!
We went up on Wednesday and left a little early in hopes of beating the traffic into the mountains.</description>

      <description>It was Saturday. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember many of the details of the day, unfortunately, but what I do remember is that we got the call that the birth mother had finally completed the harrowing experience of giving birth to who would come to be our child through the institution of domestic adoption. Over the years we&amp;rsquo;ve found that we&amp;rsquo;ve been given the gift of a wonderful, healthy, smart, and strong boy with whom we get to spend time with, learn from, be perplexed and frustrated by, and love on a day to day basis.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago I ran a Webelos Scout Camp for Ethan and his Cub Scout cohorts (I know, the scouts are an intolerant bunch, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to affect Ethan&amp;rsquo;s learning - let&amp;rsquo;s keep this among adults, shall we). The camp was pretty enjoyable - the boys were tasked with setting up the tents and camp themselves, had to take part in meal prep and cleanup, etc. Part of each camp is doing some kind of craft.</description>

      <description>My son is 10 years old! It&amp;rsquo;s tough really to get my head around that fact. I can only imagine what it is like for my parents to think about each year one of their aging children reaches another annual milestone.
9 was a pretty good year. Ethan&amp;rsquo;s shown a lot of improvement in school, thanks to his mother&amp;rsquo;s constant prodding and encouragement, he&amp;rsquo;s begun to really shine at the piano, and is starting to show real promise at soccer.</description>

      <description>Ethan belongs to the ski club at school. Last week we went skiing for the first time this year. Since Alpine is close to some friends of ours, we were able to meet up with them and their two kids, one of which, Justin, is Ethan&amp;rsquo;s age.
Justin and Ethan were having a blast! Justin snow boards, but Ethan skied. Of course, as soon as he saw Justin snow boarding, he immediately wanted to try that.</description>

      <description>Cub Scout Camp Last week, Ethan and I attended Cub Scout day camp for our second year. This year we went on the 3 day camp. Camp started at 9:00 AM and went until 4:00 PM. Besides the mosquitoes, it was a bona-fide blast for both of us. Ethan was able to do all sorts of different activities, including archery (which is is very good at), mini-golf (which he is not so good at), highlander games, knight&amp;rsquo;s quest, etc.</description>

      <title>3 S&#39;s for Ethan</title>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been awhile since I&amp;rsquo;ve updated this site on my favorite 7-year old. Ethan&amp;rsquo;s been doing quite a bit lately, now in the home stretch of his 2nd grade year, about to receive his first communion. But why the title &amp;ldquo;3 S&amp;rsquo;s for Ethan?&amp;rdquo; Really it all stems from a sad little game I play with my brain when I&amp;rsquo;m trying to remember something. I figure my brain can only remember 3 things at a time, and then only if I name them interestingly.</description>

      <description>Happy New Year!
I hope you all had a wonderful 2008 and are ready to endure what is sure to be an interesting and trying 2009. I have mailed a &amp;ldquo;2008 Year in Review&amp;rdquo; to some of you, those that I knew could take it (it&amp;rsquo;s a 30 minute video of our family). If you would like one of your own and did not receive one, please e-mail me and I will be happy to send one out to you.</description>

      <description>This past weekend was the Pewaukee Sprint Triathlon. I ran in this event last year along with a team that we had assembled known as &amp;ldquo;Big Sky Multisport.&amp;rdquo; We had our own jerseys and a whole bunch of people. Ethan was so impressed when he came to watch! He wanted to be &amp;ldquo;on my team.&amp;rdquo;
This year we did it again, and they have a kid&amp;rsquo;s event.</description>

      <description>It all started out innocently enough. We were going to church on Sunday morning, after which Ethan was supposed to attend a birthday party for a girl in his class. While in the &amp;ldquo;gathering place&amp;rdquo; after mass, Ethan was horsing around with a buddy of his when his head got bumped and one of his loose teeth started bleeding. On came the waterworks! He insisted that he was in no shape to go to the party.</description>

      <description>Morning Swim Finally, our last day at the parks. It&amp;rsquo;s been a pretty eventful week. A bit tiring, but definitely memorable. Today we had reservations at EPCOT early, 4:45, so we planned on spending the day there again. There was a lot at this park that we haven&amp;rsquo;t yet done. Also, mom and dad really like the world showcase, so there seemed plenty to do for the entire family.</description>

      <description>Late Start Quin was up during the night and we were getting tired, so we slept in a little bit this morning. Jenny and I got out for a run around the 1.4 mile running path that goes around the resort (we went twice around), we gave the kids baths, then we grabbed a leisurely breakfast at the Shutters food court at our resort. It was a good jumping off point for the rest of the day, which we planned on spending at Animal Kingdom.</description>

      <description>Magic Kingdom Part II Today we decided to try something a little different. Rather than sleeping in and dealing with the crowds of people, we thought we&amp;rsquo;d leave a little early in hopes of getting on some more rides in less confined areas. So we took off early for the bus (OK, I think we still got on the bus around 9:00) and headed for the Magic Kingdom.</description>

      <description>Good Night&amp;rsquo;s Sleep Our first night in the hotel was blissfully uneventful. My biggest worry coming to this resort with an infant was that he would be up and unconsolable in the night and he would wake people up. Turns out I had nothing to worry about all along. In fact, I would say that Quin probably slept better at the hotel than he does at home.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve written notes as things happened, but I&amp;rsquo;m going back and filling in the blanks as I get time to write them. At times it may seem a bit disjointed, so please forgive me. The dates will be posted as though they occurred on the days in which the events actually occurred, however they will not be written or posted on those actual days.</description>

      <description>My baby is 5 years old! This year&amp;rsquo;s birthday was particularly fun. Not only was he really looking forward to his birthday, but he was looking forward to his parties as well. So far Ethan&amp;rsquo;s had 2 parties. The first was on his birthday, last Wednesday. We had the Abholds, the Witte&amp;rsquo;s, and the Kelchen&amp;rsquo;s over for supper and cake. Ethan loved all of his presents he got there. Then, last weekend, we went up to Minneapolis to have a joint birthday party for Ethan and Bryce with the Grady&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>Nothing special today. I just wanted to jot some random thoughts down about Ethan so that they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be lost.
 The other day Ethan asked me, &amp;ldquo;Dad, is Jesus stronger than Superman?&amp;rdquo; Ethan has quite an affinity for his &amp;ldquo;booty.&amp;rdquo; The other day, he pulled his pants down in the back, exposing his plumber crack, and asked me, straight-faced, &amp;ldquo;has anybody seen my underwear?&amp;rdquo; He is very interested in babies and how they are made.</description>
