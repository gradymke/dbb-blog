      <title>Old Blog Reclaimed!</title>

      <description>I have a small project going on right now. I&amp;rsquo;ve downloaded my old blog from Blogspot and have started persisting it here, in a more controlled fashion - everything all in one place! Since I had over 180 posts on that blog, it will take some time to reclaim all of the old posts and reformat them to properly work here, but the work has begun. It is tedious work, involving some level of digital archaeology, but I think it is worthwhile and will make this blog much more portable in the future.</description>

      <description>Taos Our third day was dedicated to Taos. Having slept in a little, but not quite as much as the prior day, we had a little extra time to do some swimming in hopes of getting away from the crowds in the pool. We weren&amp;rsquo;t successful in avoiding crowds, but we did get about 45 minutes of swimming in before we left the hotel. Mireille, Quinton, and I played some hide and seek (it&amp;rsquo;s more fun than you would think).</description>

      <description>Los Alamos Thank goodness, today started out MUCH later than the prior one. Nobody really stirred until 9:00, giving Mireille a much needed 13 hours, and Quinton an even more needed 11.5. Of course, I was also happy to finally get 10 myself, though I was up several times in the night for the &amp;ldquo;old man pee.&amp;rdquo; While we all got ready, Jenny and Mireille went to get some coffee at the very convenient on presmises Starbucks in the lobby.</description>

      <description>AM As we suspected, and as is typical, we were up way too early. Mireille woke up around 7:00 the first time, Quinton followed about 7:30. While Mireille was able to fall back to sleep for a bit, Quinton was screaming for food by 8:00, so we were up! We left Ethan to sleep while the rest of us went down to one of the dozen or so restaurants the hotel had to offer for a nice buffet breakfast.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Are we going to the hotel tonight?&amp;rdquo; This is the question repeated at least nightly for the last two weeks by our youngest, Mireille. For some reason she just loves hotels! I think it has something to do with the swimming pools. Perhaps she just likes to travel! At any rate, it had been a constant anthem for the last several weeks - &amp;ldquo;are we going to the hotel?&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>Last Wednesday, I was able to witness the St. Pius X 2nd Trimester Honor Roll ceremony, and my favorite middle child was among the honorees. Quinton achieved all A- or better in the last trimester. In fact, he got all A&amp;rsquo;s with the exception of one A- which he got in Art.
Congratulations, Quinton!!!

      <description>I know, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t look any different. That&amp;rsquo;s sort of the beauty of this story. I&amp;rsquo;m going to warn you, if you normally come here for my amusing anecdotes about my kids, or perhaps to be regaled about my home improvement exploits, this story will probably seem somewhat dull. However, I owe this entry to the greater technological community, as there might be somebody, somewhere, that thinks even a little bit like me and are trying to do something similar to what I&amp;rsquo;m trying to do.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been awhile since we&amp;rsquo;ve done any major remodeling work to our house (yeah, right!), so it was time for us to embark on our next gigantic project. The thought was that we would do both upstairs bathrooms at more or less the same time. The kid&amp;rsquo;s bathroom was supposed to be &amp;ldquo;easy&amp;rdquo; since I was going to leave the shower pretty much alone, just update the fixtures and the shower head, but concentrate mostly on the floor, toilet, and vanity.</description>

      <description>We live in Colorado. Our families, by and large, still dwell in places throughout the Midwest. Year after year this generates some degree of conflict, particularly when it comes time for celebrating the holidays. For this holiday season, we celebrated Grady Christmas on the ever traditional weekend of the first weekend of November. For the Tibbett holiday celebration, then, we coordinated an early January celebration. Actually, it was planned to coincide with my 45th birthday, because who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to travel to the frigid midwest to stay in remote, rural Wisconsin with his in-laws on their 45th birthday!</description>

      <description>There are many traditions that I&amp;rsquo;ve learned of since leaving the nest that my family was either ignorant to or just didn&amp;rsquo;t celebrate. One happened this morning, and has for the last 21 years of my marriage, yet I still forget to celebrate it - St. Nicholas&amp;rsquo;s Day. Jenny celebrated it year after year, yet I did not, so even though I&amp;rsquo;ve now been in my adult life much longer than I was ever in my parents&amp;rsquo; home, I still forget&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Thanksgiving is literally my favorite holiday. I just love getting together with family and friends, cooking a delicious meal, eating said meal, just hanging out and napping with people. I think even more than Christmas, it is the most relaxing holiday out there!
This year, having already done the &amp;ldquo;Grady Christmas&amp;rdquo; several weeks earlier, our plan was to stay put for Thanksgiving. Luckily there are others in the greater Denver metropolitan area that are also too far away to spend the day with family, so they became our extended family for Thanksgiving.</description>

      <description>If you are familiar with our family, you know that we don&amp;rsquo;t really place a high value on vehicles. Basically whatever can get us from point A to point B reliably and without a whole lot of money in maintenance will do. In our particular family, we now have three vehicles, two Chevy Malibu&amp;rsquo;s that have a combined age approaching 30 years, and a &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; Ford Flex that is only 3 years old, but is approaching 100,000 miles itself.</description>

      <description>Not an interesting update for those that are looking for news on my adorable and smart children, but something I&amp;rsquo;m documenting for posterity, and for my own purposes.
We do quite a lot of home improvement. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been the type that likes to try something on my own before calling a professional in to do it correctly and quickly. Last weekend, a couple of long running &amp;ldquo;curiosity&amp;rdquo; type projects finally had some major movement, which, since I&amp;rsquo;m kind of a dork, made me pretty excited!</description>

      <description>This was a couple of weeks ago now, so it&amp;rsquo;s not as fresh in my mind as it was when it happened, but the event was important enough that I think it warrants documentation. You see, this was Mireille&amp;rsquo;s fifth birthday, her second in the United States.
For the weeks leading up to September 9, Mireille has been asking on a regular basis about her birthday party. She really wanted to have a party, with a bounce castle, and a cake, and presents!</description>

      <description>Jenny was talking to Mireille on Sunday about things that girls talk about. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t privvy to the details of the entire conversation, because that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be appropriate - I&amp;rsquo;m a boy. One little nugget Jenny shared with me was when Mireille admitted to her, &amp;ldquo;I wish I was a unicorn. But I&amp;rsquo;m just Mireille&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
Then, yesterday, our little Unicorn proved she listens and absorbs way more than she ever lets on.</description>

      <description>Day 4 Today started out much the same as the last. I got up &amp;ldquo;early&amp;rdquo; and headed out for a quick run around the campus. The main difference today was that Ethan decided he would come with me! He&amp;rsquo;s training for soccer and was supposed to run 5 miles over the weekend. He decided that 3.2 at 9000 feet was a rough equivalent of 5 at 5280, which I&amp;rsquo;m inclined to agree with.</description>

      <description>Day 3 Day three started out later than day 2. With nothing really pushing us out of bed, the room slept in. I got up &amp;ldquo;early&amp;rdquo; around 7:00 or so and circumnavigated the property on a &amp;ldquo;run&amp;rdquo; of sorts. Not sure you can really call it a run. Jogging occured, but a lot of walking also occurred. It was very brisk to start the day, at only 36 degF, and a bit of fog made it a little spooky, but it was good to get out and about and get the blood pumping earlyish.</description>

      <description>Day 2 Our first full day of vacation! Today is exciting because it will be most of our first time whitewater rafting. We were to be in Kremmling, about 45 miles away, by 8:30 for our half day whitewater rafting adventure. So we set an alarm for 6:30, which was fine with everybody considering we were all in bed early the night before, got dressed, had breakfast at the cafeteria, and headed west on 40 to the bustling metropolis of Kremmling via Granby.</description>

      <description>Prelude When we first moved to Colorado two years ago, we made a point of being &amp;ldquo;tourists in our own state.&amp;rdquo; It seems so often that we live somewhere and never really get to experience it like somebody who visits. Life always seems to catch up with us. Lord Soccer demands attention, work, school, the house&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s a never ending cycle of demands on our time. So we&amp;rsquo;ve tried to keep it more fresh here in Colorado, since there is so much to see out here (despite there not being any measurable amount of recreational water anywhere out here).</description>

This morning when I came in to start working for the day, I found the keyboard had lost its mind! None of the keys worked properly.</description>

      <description>As of Monday, June 26, the world has a new driver. Ethan passed his driver&amp;rsquo;s test last Friday and made it official with the DMV (and our insurance agent) on Monday. It was actually a nice thing today. It&amp;rsquo;s Bike to Work day here in Denver, so I rode my bike in. About 2 miles from home, one of my tires popped, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a repair kit with me.</description>

      <description>Summer is finally upon us. Last week was a full week without school, except for Mireille, but that&amp;rsquo;s daycare - even though she calls it school. The temperatures as of last Thursday definitely represented a shift into the ungodly hot area, though in Denver, if you can find shade, you are in good shape since the humidity is very comfortable. As a family we are definitely settling in more and more as the years have gone by.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been over a year, and Mireille continues to grow and develop. Outside of some difficulties in identifying colors (something I can&amp;rsquo;t really fault her here) and a current disinterest in letters or numbers, she&amp;rsquo;s developing quite on par with what I would expect. She does continue to have some interesting phrases, usages, and interactions from time to time that merit documentation.
Recently she has started using a phrase whenever people do something that she really doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand.</description>

      <description>Happy Mother&amp;rsquo;s Day to my kids&amp;rsquo; mom, and of course my wife, who luckily happen to be the same person! This year we celebrated by going to a brunch at one of our favorite places, Bull and Bush Brewpub! It&amp;rsquo;s a difficult thing to get all of our kids both out of the house and behaving in a public place, but for the most part they held it together through brunch.</description>

      <description>Our house was built in the 80s, 1982 to be exact. Many, if not most things have not really been touched since then. Sure, fresh paint has been applied to the walls and carpet occasionally replaced, but the &amp;ldquo;bones&amp;rdquo; of the house have remained unchanged for the last 35 years.
That changed immediately when we moved in almost 2 years ago. It started with windows, moved to the kitchen (which is still awesome, btw), moved on to doors, and now has passed to the biggest thorn remaining on the first floor, the bathroom.</description>

Still, they keep us on our toes, and I occasionally remember to write some of the remarkable things down that they do. The following is a small collection of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve remembered.

      <description>I can remember one year when we did the traditional &amp;ldquo;Holiday Letter.&amp;rdquo; It was the year that we were in the process of trying to adopt Quinton, so we were &amp;ldquo;marketing ourselves&amp;rdquo; to our family and friends that year. Looking back, it was a fun letter to do, even if it was not necessary from the salesman side of house. I thought it would be fun to condense 2016 into a bit of a letter to our family (thank you both of my readers) and so that future versions of ourselves might enjoy reading it as well.</description>

      <description>Mireille has been in the US for right around 8 months now, and she still has yet to stop amazing me with how quickly she is adjusting. It&amp;rsquo;s not only just the English, though that is remarkable, but everything else as well. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can really explain it better than I can show it with the picture below which I believe encapsulates the completeness of Mireille&amp;rsquo;s Westernization.
  Westernized Mireille   Beyond device usage and creature comforts, Mireille continues to pickup English at an alarming rate.</description>

      <title>The First Snow of the Year</title>

      <description>Last week it snowed in Denver for the first time this season. It&amp;rsquo;s a mixed bag out here for snow. People don&amp;rsquo;t really care for it in the city, like most places, but love when it happens in the mountains, where it is supposed to be. My kids certainly love it, at least the first snow.
Mireille has been saying &amp;ldquo;snow&amp;rsquo;s coming?&amp;rdquo; since about August when Jenny showed her some snow boots she could wear.</description>

      <description>Quinton loves his iPad, and he loves video games. Those are his leisure time activities, which is a funny thing to say, leisure time for an 8 year old! What he really loves to do is to enjoy both of them at the same time, which is something we try to limit for various reasons. It also presents itself as an opportunity for us when dolling out discipline.
Last week, Quinton had some egregious issue for which he had to be punished.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s October! October has been a busy month, but what month hasn&amp;rsquo;t been, really. So it&amp;rsquo;s been awhile since there&amp;rsquo;s been an update of much substance. So, while my family answers the door to greet and treat Halloween visitors in full costume, I thought I would take a few minutes (or 60) and update the world on the goings on in the Grady Household.
Adoption - Complete I don&amp;rsquo;t have to restate how much work and waiting it&amp;rsquo;s been to complete this, our second adoption.</description>

      <description>Quick one today. I need to document this, because it cracks me up. Lately Mireille has been doing magic tricks. Yes, you read that correctly - my four year old knows how to do magic tricks. Well, she knows a single trick, but she&amp;rsquo;s OK at it, and is working at it and trying to perfect it.
What she does is she takes an item and puts it in her hand.</description>

      <description>After five days of adult vacation in New Orleans, Jenny and I were happy to be back with our kids, and probably a bit surprised that five days wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite enough to really decompress! Things went back to normal very quickly.
Mirielle gas been constantly about three things - now, trick or treating, and the party that she was going to yesterday. The snow things is pretty funny. I seem to remember her not liking it very much when it showed up last spring, but just about every day she will ask us, very seriously, &amp;ldquo;snow coming?</description>

      <description>Mireille on her Fourth Birthday   Our little girl turned four!!! This was a pretty special birthday for us. It&amp;rsquo;s the first one we got to celebrate with her! We have sent her gifts for each birthday in the Congo, but I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure she hated all of those gifts. It was a weird thing - it&amp;rsquo;s very expensive to send stuff to the Congo, so we would just send one of our agency&amp;rsquo;s lawyers money and ask them to purchase something local for her.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago, friends of ours from Wisconsin contacted us and asked if we wanted to spend some time with them in Crested Butte. They have a condo there that they were going to be visiting, and we decided it would be fun to check it out. I have to say, I&amp;rsquo;m glad we did.
Crested Butte is quite a long drive from our home. At about 4.5 hours, it&amp;rsquo;s by far the furthest we&amp;rsquo;ve traveled for this summer&amp;rsquo;s adventures, but we couldn&amp;rsquo;t pass up the opportunity to check it out.</description>

      <description>You may have noticed something new when you browsed here today. No, I didn&amp;rsquo;t adopt another kid&amp;hellip; I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to shovel 12 inches of snow&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s a new theme for the website! I&amp;rsquo;m sure you are as excited as I am about the change&amp;hellip; Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter - this is my blog, and I can put whatever I want here.
This theme is awhile in the making. I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing web development for probably 17 years (well, I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretending to do it for that long - much of that time has been dedicated to managing web developers, but let&amp;rsquo;s not split hairs), and in the time I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing it, it has changed mightily.</description>

      <description>I was amused by these so I had to post them. Mireille is learning English really quickly. Not all is worthy of recording as most is mundane, but there are a few&amp;hellip;
She loves to eat! And she loves to try new food - but she doesn&amp;rsquo;t always like the food that she&amp;rsquo;s trying. When she happens to try something that she doesn&amp;rsquo;t like she says &amp;ldquo;I like this uh-uh.&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>Last summer when we moved to CO, we weren&amp;rsquo;t very busy initially, so we took the opportunity to explore our great new state. This summer, after track has ended and we&amp;rsquo;ve buttoned up most of our backlog of home improvements, we have decided to do the same thing.
Two weekends ago we went to Frisco for the weekend with Maylee and Steve. While there we stayed at a hotel, did a little shopping, visited three breweries (yeah), but the main event was a 20 mile bike ride, 10 miles each way between Frisco and Breckenridge.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s fun having somebody to drive you around, I&amp;rsquo;m finding. Since getting his permit, Ethan has logged a little over 5 hours of driving of the 50 that he needs to log by June next year in order to obtain his driver&amp;rsquo;s license. When he started driving, and after seeing the number of hours he would have to drive, I told him that there were over 300 breweries in Colorado, and the way he was going to learn how to drive was to take me to as many of them as he could&amp;hellip; Last night he told me that it was time to drive, and that I should grab my Pub Pass and we would stop for a beer somewhere.</description>

      <description>Quinton joined the Aurora Recreational Track Team this summer. We were excited about this particular activity because it would be something Quinton couldn&amp;rsquo;t just partially do. We find that, often times during soccer or basketball, Quinton is perfectly content to move at about half pace. He is bigger and faster than most of the kids he plays against in those sports, so if he plays about half way, he can still be competitive but not sweat too much.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been nearly 5 months now, and Mireille has really amped up her mastery of the English language. We recently went on vacation with the whole family to Wisconsin, so I had the opportunity to spend a lot of focused time with her. As the week went on, I started to see how she is systematically adding new words to her vocabulary all the time. First, she will point at something and ask you what it is (she says &amp;ldquo;Ques at?</description>

You see, Jenny has been traveling for work since Monday morning, leaving me, a single father of three.

It is one of a set of camps put on by an organization in town here that focuses on transracially formed families, specifically formed through adoption. Yeah, they have organizations for everything! We had been to the camp once before, two years ago, and enjoyed it so much that we decided to move to Denver!
Over the course of the two and a half days of camp we were all immersed with people in a very similar situation to our family.</description>

      <description>This post got lost in the draft folder. So I&amp;rsquo;m posting it about three weeks late.
Just for context&amp;hellip; Last weekend, my father-in-law, Bruce Tom Tibbett, passed away. It was a difficult thing to comprehend, somebody that we&amp;rsquo;ve been so close to for so long will no longer be with us. I&amp;rsquo;m sure I heard it somewhere how Freud describes the death of a parent - it reminds us of our mortality.</description>

      <description>For some reason, Quinton has decided lately that he wants to be an actor. He feels he could be rich, and feels that he&amp;rsquo;s every bit as good as the people he&amp;rsquo;s seen on TV and movies.
Yesterday on our trip back from Colorado Springs where we were watching soccer, Quinton was going into great detail about what would happen when he&amp;rsquo;s an actor. First I told him that he&amp;rsquo;d probably need to hire an agent.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s not often that I blog about our oldest son, Ethan. He&amp;rsquo;s not cute and little anymore. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t say stupid things innocently so that I can have poignant teaching moments with him&amp;hellip; Well, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t do that as often, and he would probably take exception to me announcing them to the world now that he&amp;rsquo;s all social media savvy and all.
Ethan has grown into quite the young man. Though he is only 15, he has already learned many of life&amp;rsquo;s most important lessons, mainly the ones about treating others as you would want to be treated - he excels at that.</description>

      <description>Mireille has been in the US for around 2 months now and by all accounts is doing pretty well. One thing that we constantly worry about is whether she is picking up English quickly enough. Of course we are on all these Facebook groups and we constantly hear about how much English people&amp;rsquo;s kids are picking up and Mireille has been a bit slow on that front. I tend to think many of those people are embellishing their stories quite a bit, but whatever - she is a strong willed girl and she&amp;rsquo;s going to speak Lingala, dammit!</description>

      <description>8 years ago yesterday, we were given a call that Quinton&amp;rsquo;s birth mother was going into labor. By 10:30 AM on this morning, 8 years ago, Quinton was born!
It&amp;rsquo;s hard to believe that it&amp;rsquo;s been 8 years. Looking back on the pictures, so much has happened. He has grown so much, made us laugh, made us cry, asked so many important questions, and taught us things we never thought we even needed to know.</description>

      <description>As a sort of late birthday present, a few of our Wisconsin friends came out and enjoyed a ski weekend with us at Copper Mountain, the resort where we have our season passes. Tim Z. was the first to arrive on Friday afternoon. After dropping off the dog, then picking Tim up from the airport, we headed west through typically terrible Denver traffic - perhaps leaving at 4:30 was a poor decision.</description>

      <description>So&amp;hellip; There are a couple of updates, but we&amp;rsquo;re still stuck.
The US sent a delegation of congressmen to the DRC to talk specifically about this issue. As has become typical, the DRC responded with things that we want to hear. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into details, but I wanted to document, for posterity, the letter I wrote to my congressmen in Colorado. I&amp;rsquo;ve been interacting with their offices for the past couple of months and have a fairly good rapport going with my contacts.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I posted about Quinton&amp;rsquo;s recent obsession with Football in a prior post or two. If not, let me just say that Quinton has fallen HARD for football and all things about it. It&amp;rsquo;s to the point where he will actually put down his iPad (gasp) and ask me to turn on a football game when he knows one will be on. If you know Quinton, you know that is not something to take lightly.</description>

      <description>Most days are pretty much the same. I get up at 5:30, shower, get Ethan up at 6:00, make breakfast for us, then leave around 6:30 to get him to School. After that I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what typically happens as Jenny just takes care of it. Well, last week I had the opportunity to walk Quinton to school because Ethan had final exams and would be getting done around the time Quinton would normally be going to school.</description>

      <description>One of these days I will get around to posting the epic project that we&amp;rsquo;ve undertaken of redoing our kitchen. It&amp;rsquo;s been about 4 months in the making and we&amp;rsquo;re hitting the final stretch! Last week the countertops were installed so we finally got our new sink installed. Unfortunately, the countertop guys don&amp;rsquo;t do plumbing, so that&amp;rsquo;s my job!
I had budgeted three trips to the hardware store, and I was right on the money!</description>

      <description>Our first major holiday in Colorado is my favorite of all holidays, Thanksgiving! While it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to not be able to spend it with family, we were able to make good memories of it by spending it in the Mountains at a ski resort. Hopefully this is something we will make a tradition out of, because it was a lot of fun!
We went up on Wednesday and left a little early in hopes of beating the traffic into the mountains.</description>

      <description>Grady Family Farm - circa 1980   The picture is of the farm I grew up on that is 13 miles north and west of Marquette, Iowa- The present owners took down the barn, chicken house, granary, and corn crib- but curiously left the outhouse that is south of the house. The picture is looking to the west and the farm my mother grew up on is the one in the distant west, just in viewing- you can not see the church and cemetery that is less than on quarter of a mile to the right in the picture- St Pius V Catholic Church, Cherry Mound where my Mom and Dad are buried and where I mowed every summer for about six years- I knew every tombstone in the cemetery and when someone wanted to know where their relative was buried, the priest would contact me and I would show them.</description>

      <description>Thought I would put this out there as I had never thought of this before. We needed to hang our bikes in the garage. I didn&amp;rsquo;t really want to spend too much money on hardware, so we just got the cheap hooks that you can get at Home Depot - they were like $1.50 each. I typically don&amp;rsquo;t like using those hooks because it&amp;rsquo;s a pain to find studs to drill and put them into, and then when you do, it rarely lines up with the thing you want to hang.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve known us for any amount of time, you know that we are, and have been in the process of adopting from the Democratic Republic of Congo for the past 3 years. It has been a long, LONG process.
TL;DR; Last month, the Congolese government has dashed our hopes of completing this adoption in the near timeframe. It is questionable if we will ever be able to complete it.</description>

      <description>We are first year Coloradoans, so we are behaving like them. We purchased season ski passes, even though it is next to impossible to get into the mountains due to all the traffic. We are in the process of upgrading all of our equipment because no Coloradoan would be caught dead with the 10 year old skis that we have!
Since we are planning on going to the mountains for our first trip over Thanksgiving, we needed to get some equipment for Quinton and Ethan.</description>

Last weekend we finally got to the point where we could take out our old lower cabinets and replace them with the new ones. The plan was to demolish on Saturday and install on Sunday.</description>

      <description>Jenny had Quinton write a letter to Santa. Since he was also typing a thank you letter to his grandparents on my e-mail, he decided to e-mail his letter to Santa this year. I came across it in my drafts folder and found it amusing.

      <description>New words for the dictionary:
becept /bee * &amp;lsquo;cept/
Origin - from what I can tell, a combination of except and besides. Perfectly encapsulates the meaning of both in different situations.
Example: &amp;ldquo;Everyone is having fun becept me.&amp;rdquo;
w&amp;rsquo;bout /wuh * &amp;lsquo;bout/
Origin - shortened version of &amp;ldquo;what about.&amp;rdquo; Not particularly interesting for its meaning but rather it&amp;rsquo;s usage.
Example: &amp;ldquo;The moon doesn&amp;rsquo;t have it&amp;rsquo;s own light - it only reflects the sun&amp;rsquo;s light.</description>

      <description>Quinton has really wanted a remote control airplane for quite some time. Uncle Blaine bought him a remote control helicopter a little over a year ago that he absolutely loved for the entirety of the 10 minutes before he lost it in the trees. Over the years he&amp;rsquo;s amassed quite the aresnal of cheap, crappy remote control things - cars, trucks, motorcycles - each one cheaper and crappier than the last.</description>

      <description>We got to Skype with Mireille this morning. It&amp;rsquo;s always bittersweet talking with her. On the one hand, you want to make sure you keep in touch so she at least has some sort of connection, but on another hand it just sort of hurts to talk with her. When we talk with her, we are reminded of the situation that we&amp;rsquo;re in, whereas other times we can sort of ignore it.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago (well, over a month ago now), we took a trip to Glenwood Springs, CO. It was a trip to celebrate the end of summer and to get away for a little bit before the kids started school the next week. It was a nice long weekend, though the traffic coming down from the mountains left little to be desired.
At a high level, we walked around, went on some long bike rides along the Colorado River, visited a wild west theme park on the top of a mountain, took a cave tour, and did the hike at Hanging Lake.</description>

      <description>This won&amp;rsquo;t really benefit Mireille, but a family in much the same situation we are in has started a fund to help bring food to orphans in need in Kinshasa. We&amp;rsquo;re planning on doing some fund raising to help this organization. Despite your feelings on international adoption, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to disagree with helping children to get nutritious food and water.
Please consider donating.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m outing us to the world. Well, Jenny outed us on Facebook about a month ago, but this post makes it official - we are in the process of adopting a little girl from the Democratic Republic of Congo. In fact, we&amp;rsquo;ve been matched with our daughter for 18 months, and are in fact her legal parents by that country&amp;rsquo;s laws. In a very strange combination of power plays and international politics, however, we are unable to bring her home to the United States.</description>

      <description>It was Saturday. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember many of the details of the day, unfortunately, but what I do remember is that we got the call that the birth mother had finally completed the harrowing experience of giving birth to who would come to be our child through the institution of domestic adoption. Over the years we&amp;rsquo;ve found that we&amp;rsquo;ve been given the gift of a wonderful, healthy, smart, and strong boy with whom we get to spend time with, learn from, be perplexed and frustrated by, and love on a day to day basis.</description>

A couple of quick ones, though. First, Ethan has had a couple of milestones in the last few weeks. As a seventh grader, Ethan decided he was going to run for his school&amp;rsquo;s student council as the vice president.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s On Fire!&amp;rdquo; When I was in college, one of my favorite games on the Sega Genesis was NBA Jam. It was great. You could crank out a game in 15 minutes, everybody could play, and best of all, most of the time, I would win. A couple of weekends ago I got nostalgic. Ethan has all sorts of time to play all these complicated games. I want nothing more than to do that, but have other priorities than an 11 year old boy does (getting old sucks).</description>

      <description>n has finally succumb to the fates of his genes, or I suppose since we&amp;rsquo;re (yes, that was intentional) learning about heredity in science right now, the alleles that he&amp;rsquo;s been gifted from Jenny and I, and has gotten glasses. His prescription is very mild - he only needs them for class, pretty much, not for sports or basically anything else. But it has begun. Later this year we will probably be putting him in braces (for his teeth, not his legs).</description>

Jenny and I have started pursuing another adoption, this time an international one through the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire). So far much has been the same as last time around - filling out paperwork, background checks, talking about my feelings - fun stuff. We&amp;rsquo;re getting to the point where we will be having a social worker come to the house to interview us, so we were explaining to Quinton what we were doing.</description>

Jenny and I were both signed up to do the sprint triathlon, a 1&amp;frasl;4 mile swim, 15 mile bike, then 3.1 mile run. We&amp;rsquo;ve done it a few years in a row now, so that&amp;rsquo;s not what I&amp;rsquo;m writing about - this year we decided to let our kids participate in the kid&amp;rsquo;s event on the Saturday prior to the adult races.</description>

      <description>Have you ever heard the &amp;ldquo;Little Johnny&amp;rdquo; jokes? For several reasons, I have a feeling that they might one day be replaced by &amp;ldquo;Little Quinny&amp;rdquo; jokes. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of one - Little Johnny was in class learning his ABCs. The teacher was asking the class to name something with each letter of the alphabet in order. Little Johnny raised his hand for each letter, but she kept skipping him thinking that he would say something bad, like &amp;ldquo;ass&amp;rdquo; for A and &amp;ldquo;butt&amp;rdquo; for B.</description>

      <description>We had the opportunity to travel to Spread Eagle, WI near Iron Mountain, MI for Memorial Day this year. A friend of ours works for a company that owns a &amp;ldquo;cabin&amp;rdquo; on a lake up there, which they allow their employees to rent by the week during the year. When say cabin, I mean a 5 bedroom, 4000 square foot, modern home that is situated on a lake up north. So we joined 3 other families up there for the weekend.</description>

      <description>My boys really don&amp;rsquo;t think much, normally, before a Hallmark Holiday like Mother&amp;rsquo;s Day. Last night, however, Ethan asked me (discretely) what mom&amp;rsquo;s favorite breakfast was. I told him that she liked an egg over easy with toast. He nodded, then said that he&amp;rsquo;d like to make that for her in the morning.
So this morning, Quin (and I, I suppose) woke up a little after 6:00. He watched Garfield while I watched the inside of my eyelids for an hour more.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s tough for me to write today because my favorite group of millionaires lost to somebody else&amp;rsquo;s favorite group of millionaires in a game I was sure would go my millionaire&amp;rsquo;s way. Oh well, we must persevere!
It&amp;rsquo;s been a typical busy couple of weeks. Today was one of Ethan&amp;rsquo;s last functions as a Cub Scout, the Pinewood Derby. For most kids this is an exciting event, but for Ethan and I, we sort of dread it.</description>

      <description>The last day of vacation is always the dreaded travel day. We were lucky enough to be able to get some laundry done at mom and dad&amp;rsquo;s before we left (OK, Jenny got it done), so we (Jenny) would not have to do it when we (Jenny) got home. But travel days are always a pain. Most of the morning was spent biding time until our flight. We departed pretty early for the airport - we had a 1:00 flight and arrived at the airport at 11:00, so we had plenty of time to get some pizza and wait at the gate.</description>

      <description>Day 8 was to be a relaxing day! In that right, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too bad. Mom and dad wanted to show off their new winter home state to us, though, so we headed out of town on Arizona 88 around 10:30 to catch up on some history and engineering marvels. Our first stop was Tortilla Flat, a (very) small stop on the way up to the Roosevelt Dam on the Salt River.</description>

      <description>There was no plan in the works for today other than to drive back to Phoenix at some point. Small portion of the day, only 6.5 hours&amp;hellip; Surprisingly, though, it seemed relaxed since we didn&amp;rsquo;t have an itinerary. So we started out the day like we did any other day on vacation, we ate at a local breakfast establishment. This time we found a local favorite, Panera Bread. Excellent bagels and sandwiches - oh who am I kidding, we just wanted something fast.</description>

      <description>In case there was any question to the subtitle of yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post, we were watching the weather where the cute weather lady exclaimed that the clouds were pretty moist and deep, and that she wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised to see them start to rain at any time. I found that amusing - I suppose I&amp;rsquo;ve never really progressed past the age of 12 as far as my maturity level goes&amp;hellip;
I again find myself 3 days tardy in posting this, so I think this will be pretty short.</description>

      <description>Man, I have to start doing these as they happen. This is my third log today!!! To get me through it, I&amp;rsquo;ve gone to the fridge to finish off my San Diego brew sampler with a Karl Strauss Brewing Company Boardwalk Black Rye. Tasty!!!
Today&amp;rsquo;s plan was to go to Seaworld. We figured we would do things a little differently today since we completely missed supper yesterday, so we opted for a smaller breakfast of Subway sandwiches and Starbucks.</description>

      <description>Day 4 - San Diego. Today started out early with Quin waking around 6:00 - he&amp;rsquo;s getting better. He and I passed time playing iOS games on the iPhone and iPad in the second room of our suite while Jenny and Ethan grabbed 90 more minutes of sleep. By 7:30, Jenny got up and I hit the road for a quick run along the water.
By 9:00 we were off for a full day of vacationing.</description>

      <description>Since we were up by 6:00 anyway, we decided to try to get an early start at things, so we got ready and left by 8:00. My parents graciously lent us their vehicle - they are currently going without any sort of motorized vehicle of their own, relying instead on pedal power and favors from friends - so we loaded it up and took off on our 6 and 1&amp;frasl;2 hour drive to San Diego.</description>

      <description>As should probably be expected, since Quin went to bed at around 6:00 local time, he woke up around 4:30 local. I suppose the day was going to start early! We aimed to do quite a bit during this day, but ultimately decided to back it off a bit seeing as how we were still a bit groggy from the previous day&amp;rsquo;s travels. We did manage to get to the (Superstition Mountain Museum)[http://www.</description>

      <description>3:45 AM - the alarm called out the start of our Great West Adventure. We were ticketed for a 7:00 departure from Milwaukee&amp;rsquo;s General Mitchell Airport. With 3 and 10 year old in tow, we didn&amp;rsquo;t want to leave anything to risk. So we all showered the night before, set the alarm for 3:45, and aimed to leave by 4:15.
The plan went off without a hitch - the crew was excited for the trip.</description>

      <description>Neither Jenny nor I are very good about creating content for a baby book. In fact, I know I could not tell you where either of my children&amp;rsquo;s baby books are - perhaps in the top of our closet collecting dust. To capture memories, though, I&amp;rsquo;ve turned to this &amp;lsquo;blog. It worked out pretty well with Ethan so far, and Quinton has been no different. This post, then, is going to be some quick hitters to get into Quinton&amp;rsquo;s virtual baby book.</description>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago I ran a Webelos Scout Camp for Ethan and his Cub Scout cohorts (I know, the scouts are an intolerant bunch, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to affect Ethan&amp;rsquo;s learning - let&amp;rsquo;s keep this among adults, shall we). The camp was pretty enjoyable - the boys were tasked with setting up the tents and camp themselves, had to take part in meal prep and cleanup, etc. Part of each camp is doing some kind of craft.</description>

I told her no problem, grabbed a blank DVD which I promptly attempted to insert into my Mac superdrive. I was somewhat surprised to find that I could not put the DVD into the drive, however. The computer did not say there was anything in the drive&amp;hellip; Quite strange, I thought. I suppose that there could be a disc in there that the OS didn&amp;rsquo;t know about somehow, a computer glitch.</description>

      <description>My son is 10 years old! It&amp;rsquo;s tough really to get my head around that fact. I can only imagine what it is like for my parents to think about each year one of their aging children reaches another annual milestone.
9 was a pretty good year. Ethan&amp;rsquo;s shown a lot of improvement in school, thanks to his mother&amp;rsquo;s constant prodding and encouragement, he&amp;rsquo;s begun to really shine at the piano, and is starting to show real promise at soccer.</description>

      <description>So - potty training boys&amp;hellip; Yeah&amp;hellip; Well, we&amp;rsquo;re still doing pretty well, but something new has reared its ugly head. Now that Quin knows when he has to go to the bathroom, and no longer does it in his pants, he has decided that he wants to find other things to pee on other than the toilet. Jenny caught him peeing in the bathtub the other day. Yesterday I stopped him from going in the garbage can and in the refrigerator, while Jenny caught him trying to spray down the plunger in the bathroom.</description>

      <description>Boy, a week makes a big difference. As of today, Quin is a week without diapers (while conscious). Last Saturday, Quin finally decided that he really, REALLY wanted to wear his light-up shoes all the time. He woke up on Saturday morning and told me, &amp;ldquo;daddy, I want my light-up shoes.&amp;rdquo; I told him that he had to wear underwear if he wanted to do that, and he thought that was OK.</description>

Justin and Ethan were having a blast! Justin snow boards, but Ethan skied. Of course, as soon as he saw Justin snow boarding, he immediately wanted to try that.</description>

      <description>Wow, it&amp;rsquo;s been a long time again! I hope to post multiple times this week to get caught up. So much to talk about!
Well, it started a few weeks ago with Quin getting sick. The sickness eventually spread throughout the house but Quin got it first. The poor guy was just listless, throwing up, no fever, but sick. Every time he threw up over the course of several hours he just did it over the bucket, no crying or anything.</description>

First he pestered me until I came to &amp;ldquo;play me.&amp;rdquo; So I followed him upstairs where he declared that he saw a monster. For the next 30 minutes we were hiding, kicking, and even kissing the poor monster until his daddy put him to bed (both monsters). Good times&amp;hellip;</description>

He has his favorites, though. My latest favorites are &amp;ldquo;nan&amp;rdquo; which means &amp;ldquo;dance,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;nonut,&amp;rdquo; which means &amp;ldquo;donut.&amp;rdquo;
Quin has a definite love of dancing. He has figured out how to turn on various CD players and radios throughout the house, and once they are on, he will come and grab one of us to come and &amp;ldquo;nan.</description>

Jenny and Ethan are out looking at the little Colorado river gorge about 15 miles east of the south rim park of the grand canyon. It&amp;rsquo;s not too cold out but I bet the wind is gusting up to 50 mph. It&amp;rsquo;s so bad that it tipped over 2 portapotties.
Quinny is napping. We left him in the car to start with but then felt guilty so now I&amp;rsquo;m hanging out with him.</description>

Nature dictates that the oldest is silly like his dad, but nurture appears to have a strong influence on the youngest. Too bad - we thought he had a chance!!!
We were out and about gathering materials for our latest home improvement project, built-in cabinets and a desk in our office (the wood floor was finished up two weeks ago).</description>

      <description>Of course my wife reminded me of some things I forgot&amp;hellip; If only she knew how to blog!
The other day Ethan and I were driving to Soccer when we passed a section of road we frequently pass. On one side of the road is a pretty steep, tree-covered hill with a couple of houses on top. Ethan asked me, matter of factly, if the people living there were hillbillies. To be honest, I was laughing to myself, but calmly collected myself before explaining that they were not hillbillies.</description>

      <description>Quin climbed out of his crib the other day. We were working around the house and he was acting like he was tired. He generally doesn&amp;rsquo;t like to take naps during the day, but we like him to take naps. So I put him in his crib and began to let him &amp;ldquo;cry it out.&amp;rdquo; I went outside to take care of something, and a couple of minutes later came back inside to find Quin standing downstairs, smiling at me.</description>

      <description>Kissing Cousins These pictures are from awhile ago, but I thought they were cute enough to post anyway!!! This is a picture of Quinton kissing his cousin. Man, he&amp;rsquo;s really going for it! OK, they are second cousins once removed, or third cousins or something (you&amp;rsquo;d have to ask Blaine for the exact designation), so that&amp;rsquo;s probably OK in most You can tell they are from awhile ago as they were for Jodi&amp;rsquo;s baby shower - and they&amp;rsquo;ve already had the baby!</description>

      <description>Cub Scout Camp Last week, Ethan and I attended Cub Scout day camp for our second year. This year we went on the 3 day camp. Camp started at 9:00 AM and went until 4:00 PM. Besides the mosquitoes, it was a bona-fide blast for both of us. Ethan was able to do all sorts of different activities, including archery (which is is very good at), mini-golf (which he is not so good at), highlander games, knight&amp;rsquo;s quest, etc.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been awhile since I&amp;rsquo;ve updated this site on my favorite 7-year old. Ethan&amp;rsquo;s been doing quite a bit lately, now in the home stretch of his 2nd grade year, about to receive his first communion. But why the title &amp;ldquo;3 S&amp;rsquo;s for Ethan?&amp;rdquo; Really it all stems from a sad little game I play with my brain when I&amp;rsquo;m trying to remember something. I figure my brain can only remember 3 things at a time, and then only if I name them interestingly.</description>

      <description>Quin and Ethan have been busy folks as of late. Quin went and turned one and we barely even acknowledged it! Well, digitally anyway. In true Grady boy fashion, Quin celebrated his birthday not once, not twice, but three separate times so that he could cover all his bases. Our favorite celebration was the one we had at our house with just our little family, though. It was the first time Quin really got to dig into some chocolate cake, and boy do I think he was impressed!</description>

      <description>As of last night, Quinton has become one of the walkers of the world. He took his first tenuous steps from Jenny to myself last night before bed. Everybody was very excited. Well, Ethan was a little disappointed since he was in the shower when it happened, but was excited nonetheless. Looks like it&amp;rsquo;s time to get the house to the next level of baby-proofness.

      <description>Ethan We had Ethan&amp;rsquo;s parent-teacher conference yesterday. He is doing very well in School, mostly thanks to Jenny. She works with him constantly on his school work as well as reading, basic math and the like. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot of work, but it is apparently paying off. While in the conference we were able to read some of Ethan&amp;rsquo;s stories and reports that he&amp;rsquo;s been writing up. I plan on posting a couple of them to this blog in the near future.</description>

      <description>Quin has learned the fine art of movement. He still doesn&amp;rsquo;t really &amp;ldquo;crawl,&amp;rdquo; necessarily, but he lilts along like an army man. Actually he looks a little like Igor would look if he crawled. Since he&amp;rsquo;s been in motion, he&amp;rsquo;s bee quite happy and quite a handful. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember if Ethan got into as much when he was younger, but Quin really likes to get into everything!
Unfortunately, Quin&amp;rsquo;s also been sick for the last week or so.</description>

      <description>That&amp;rsquo;s right, Quin&amp;rsquo;s a Grady! Poor kid&amp;hellip; On October 2, 2008, we had our final court date at the Waukesha County Juvenile Court to finalize, legally, our adoption. Largely it was uneventful, but it still managed to choke me up a little bit. While there we met another family that was finalizing, except this was their THIRD adoption! Crazy folks!
Quin&amp;rsquo;s getting bigger and moving around more and more all the time.</description>

Quin&amp;rsquo;s doing great! He&amp;rsquo;s 7 months old now and is quite mobile. No, he still doesn&amp;rsquo;t (really) crawl, but has developed a rolling technique that enables him to get pretty much wherever he wants to go. He&amp;rsquo;s also started to try out the &amp;ldquo;all fours&amp;rdquo; thing by getting up on his knees and lunching towards things that are slightly out of his reach.</description>

      <description>No, it&amp;rsquo;s not Ethan, and it&amp;rsquo;s not Barley either. That&amp;rsquo;s right, Quin&amp;rsquo;s first tooth has finally busted its way through his gums. We were wondering why he&amp;rsquo;s been so crabby lately, and the old &amp;ldquo;well, he&amp;rsquo;s probably teething&amp;rdquo; excuse was wearing a little thin some 4 months later. But lo and behold, it really was true this time!
Here you can see him having a deep conversation with an old Elmo doll.</description>

      <description>Last week, Quin got to partake in his first State Fair. He &amp;ldquo;fared&amp;rdquo; pretty well, though I&amp;rsquo;m not sure it was entirely his cup of tea just yet. Ethan had a blast, at least for the most part. We started out by getting a wrist band and going on the rides. This is really the first year where Ethan was ready to go on the &amp;ldquo;big kids&amp;rdquo; rides.</description>

      <description>After having been read the riot act by my mother, I have decided to finally make a most delayed post. In the past two weeks, Quin has been passing milestones by the handful and I have neglected to document them here, so here goes.
Two weeks ago Friday, Quin passed not one, not two, but three milestones in a 12 hour period. First, he ate rice cereal for the first time, and gobbled it up completely.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m just sitting here doing some scout stuff and Quin is sitting right next to me in one of his bouncy chairs. What&amp;rsquo;s different than normal is that he is grabbing *everything* within reach. He has access to a bunch of toys within reach and he is studying each one of them intently. This is a first for him and quite exciting for us.</description>

      <description>It all started out innocently enough. We were going to church on Sunday morning, after which Ethan was supposed to attend a birthday party for a girl in his class. While in the &amp;ldquo;gathering place&amp;rdquo; after mass, Ethan was horsing around with a buddy of his when his head got bumped and one of his loose teeth started bleeding. On came the waterworks! He insisted that he was in no shape to go to the party.</description>

      <description>Quin is 9 weeks old now!!! We&amp;rsquo;ve had a good couple of weeks with him so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share with the lot of you.
First off, he&amp;rsquo;s now eating about 5 ounces at a time every 4 hours. Unfortunately, he&amp;rsquo;s still doing that at night as well. Although, some nights he&amp;rsquo;s been known to go 6 or more hours between feedings, and when he does wake up to eat, he&amp;rsquo;s very good about going back to sleep promptly.</description>

Today we had reservations at EPCOT early, 4:45, so we planned on spending the day there again. There was a lot at this park that we haven&amp;rsquo;t yet done. Also, mom and dad really like the world showcase, so there seemed plenty to do for the entire family.</description>

      <description>Late Start Quin was up during the night and we were getting tired, so we slept in a little bit this morning. Jenny and I got out for a run around the 1.4 mile running path that goes around the resort (we went twice around), we gave the kids baths, then we grabbed a leisurely breakfast at the Shutters food court at our resort. It was a good jumping off point for the rest of the day, which we planned on spending at Animal Kingdom.</description>

Rather than sleeping in and dealing with the crowds of people, we thought we&amp;rsquo;d leave a little early in hopes of getting on some more rides in less confined areas. So we took off early for the bus (OK, I think we still got on the bus around 9:00) and headed for the Magic Kingdom.</description>

      <description>Good Night&amp;rsquo;s Sleep Our first night in the hotel was blissfully uneventful. My biggest worry coming to this resort with an infant was that he would be up and unconsolable in the night and he would wake people up. Turns out I had nothing to worry about all along. In fact, I would say that Quin probably slept better at the hotel than he does at home.</description>

Jenny had to go in to work today, so Quin and I worked from home, and let me tell you, he does better work than some of the interns I&amp;rsquo;ve had! I fed him once at 7:00, then he didn&amp;rsquo;t want to eat again until around noon (my mistake as I got lost in e-mails for awhile).</description>

      <description>Yesterday we got the call that Quin was going to be discharged from the hospital. It was going to be later in the day, so we took Ethan out of school around 12:30 and headed over to the hospital. When we walked into the nursery, we were surprised to find two doctors circumcising Quin. We thought that had happened already in the morning! Well, it was somewhat interesting to watch, but Ethan was not so impressed.</description>

Tonight was the annual Harvest Dance at school. The gym had a bouncy castle and a bunch of games. We spent nearly 2 hours there.</description>

      <description>OK, it&amp;rsquo;s been quite awhile again, but I thought the time was right to update some of Ethan&amp;rsquo;s stats on this site. Really what forced me to do it was some of the things Ethan said to me tonight.
First thing&amp;rsquo;s first, Ethan has an adult tooth coming in behind his existing baby teeth on the bottom of his mouth. Jenny and I don&amp;rsquo;t really know anything about this, so we took him to the dentist.</description>

Yesterday we were outside talking about the new DVD he took out from the library. He said that one part doesn&amp;rsquo;t play very well, and told me that the reason was &amp;ldquo;probably because mommy put a fingerprint on the shiny side.&amp;rdquo;</description>

Not only was he really looking forward to his birthday, but he was looking forward to his parties as well. So far Ethan&amp;rsquo;s had 2 parties. The first was on his birthday, last Wednesday. We had the Abholds, the Witte&amp;rsquo;s, and the Kelchen&amp;rsquo;s over for supper and cake. Ethan loved all of his presents he got there. Then, last weekend, we went up to Minneapolis to have a joint birthday party for Ethan and Bryce with the Grady&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

Ice Age 2 is the second movie by Blue Sky Productions (I think) under the Fox production company. Like the first Ice Age, it is a computer animated movie about three prehistoric animals who became a &amp;ldquo;herd&amp;rdquo; of their own.
This time around, the world is warming up and all of the animals live in a large bowl formed by an 80 foot high ice dam.</description>

      <description>Nothing very long today. I just have some nuggets from the past couple of days that are worth sharing.
Yesterday we were driving back from KFC and Ethan could smell some of the food. He mentioned something about how good the food smelled and then said, &amp;ldquo;Mmm, the sweet smell of french fries!&amp;rdquo;
Then, today we were outside changing the oil in the lawn mower, and Ethan turned to me and said, &amp;ldquo;Dad, if you eat fire, then you will fart fire, and your tongue will be on fire, too.</description>

      <description>Nothing special today. I just wanted to jot some random thoughts down about Ethan so that they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be lost.
 The other day Ethan asked me, &amp;ldquo;Dad, is Jesus stronger than Superman?&amp;rdquo; Ethan has quite an affinity for his &amp;ldquo;booty.&amp;rdquo; The other day, he pulled his pants down in the back, exposing his plumber crack, and asked me, straight-faced, &amp;ldquo;has anybody seen my underwear?&amp;rdquo; He is very interested in babies and how they are made.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t remember the exact context, but the other day Ethan was saying some pretty funny stuff. He was talking about liking something or not liking something (what, I can&amp;rsquo;t remember), and a couple of minutes into it he said, &amp;ldquo;I changed my mind, I like it. I must be out of my mind.&amp;ldquo;
Today we took Ethan to the Curious George movie. Jenny and I both liked it, although it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have as much to enjoy for adults as do some other recent &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; movies.</description>

      <description>One of Ethan&amp;rsquo;s favorite things to do is to watch movies. He is probably one of the youngest movie &amp;ldquo;quoters&amp;rdquo; that I know. In the last few days, Ethan and I have seen a couple of new movies that are notworthy in that they have left an impression on Ethan.
The first movie we saw was during the Bears-Panthers game on Sunday, Hoodwinked. Hoodwinked is the story of Little Red Riding Hood told from perspective of those involved, Red, Grandma, the Big Bad Wolf, and the axe wielding Schnitzel truck driver.</description>

      <description>Wow, has my son turned into a little snot all of a sudden. If this is what it&amp;rsquo;s like to have teen-agers, I want no part of it. I know, I know, those are much worse! I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what happened, but since I picked him up from school today he has been quite a little snot. He started by informing me that I&amp;rsquo;m not the boss, and that he didn&amp;rsquo;t like me anymore.</description>

      <description>Ethan had a second Christmas program this year, this time at his old school (daycare). At the daycare Christmas program, you can only watch your child sing because there just isn&amp;rsquo;t room for everybody to be in the LMR (large muscle room) at the same time.
Anyway, after Ethan&amp;rsquo;s portion of the program was done, we joined him, his classmates, and their parents in his room, the 4 1&amp;frasl;2 year old room for cookies and punch.</description>

      <description>Last night was Ethan&amp;rsquo;s unofficial first Christmas concert as a &amp;ldquo;grade schooler.&amp;rdquo; He&amp;rsquo;s had a concert every year in daycare, but this is the first time he had an &amp;ldquo;audience.&amp;rdquo; Both sets of grandparents braved the 200 mile trek to see their grandson dance and &amp;ldquo;sing&amp;rdquo; Christmas songs with his classmates. It was a nice concert, held in the church with all the other kids in St. Bruno&amp;rsquo;s school, which includes kids through 8th grade.</description>

      <description>Life should be filled with more days like today. It was one of the most relaxing, yet fulfulling days I&amp;rsquo;ve had in quite awhile, and will not be soon forgotten.
It started out last night, really. The whole family went to Kohls to do a little &amp;ldquo;midnight&amp;rdquo; Christmas shopping. OK, it was actually about 7:30 when we went, but for all intents and purposes (from Ethan&amp;rsquo;s standpoint) it was close to midnight.</description>

      <description>Ethan had his first non-family birthday party on Sunday. It was for Robert Dent, a boy from his daycare, who was turning five. They had the party at M&amp;amp;M Gymnastics in New Berlin and it involved doing some tumbling and eating pizza. Looked like fun. Mostly, though, it reminded me how old Ethan was getting.
Ethan also got to spend the day with our friends Micky and Tim on Saturday as Jenny and I had to go to a wedding.</description>

      <description>I’m sure I’ve been more proud of Ethan, but I can’t remember when. Tonight Ethan showed me that he can snap his fingers. About a week ago he showed me that he could whistle… I think it was a couple of weeks ago that he had asked me on separate occasions how to whistle and how to snap your fingers. I showed him what I knew, but ultimately, it is hard to teach somebody how to do something like that.</description>

      <description>Yesterday marked the first snow of the season. Unlike most years when it snows for the first time, this snow stayed on the ground. Ethan was so excited this morning to see snow. His eyes lit up and he exclaimed that &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s almost Christmas!&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>Yesterday we went to the Badger/Hawkeye game, a thing we intend to do each year. Todd and Theresa, my uncle and aunt who live near Madison, offerred to watch Ethan for the day. He had a fine time, and the Hawkeyes won the game much to many a Madisonion&amp;rsquo;s chagrin. Ethan has always gotten along very well with Julia, the older of Todd&amp;rsquo;s two children, but lately he has been doing more and getting along very well with John, Julia&amp;rsquo;s younger brother.</description>

      <description>Ethan has been saying some funny things, lately. First, since it&amp;rsquo;s been Halloween season, he has seen the Grim Reaper walking around on TV and on the streets. He has been calling him the &amp;ldquo;Grim Reefer&amp;rdquo; however.
The other funny thing he has done lately is to sing the song Tootsie Roll. There&amp;rsquo;s just something funny about a 4 year old singing &amp;ldquo;Let me see your tootsie role&amp;rdquo; to me&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>We went to Wisconsin Dells with the Abholds on Thursday afternoon. My parents obtained a free night stay since they were treated badly at the Kalahari. They gave us the free night stay, so we traded it in for $129 off of a suite. Not a bad deal.
If you’re not familiar with the Kalahari, it is a huge hotel and conference center with a large indoor and outdoor water park attached.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to call this year Ethan&amp;rsquo;s first Halloween. Sure he has had four other Halloweens, but this one was special. It was the first time that he actively participated and enjoyed himself. He is growing so fast it is unbelievable, and I don&amp;rsquo;t mean he is getting tall. Instead of being afraid to go to any of the houses, he actively pointed out the houses that he wanted to go to based on what kind of candy he thought they would have.</description>

      <description>&amp;ndash; title: &amp;ldquo;Adventures in Potty Training&amp;rdquo; date: 2011-03-20T21:06:00Z updated: 2011-03-20T21:24:32Z tags: [&amp;ldquo;Quin&amp;rdquo;]
categories: [&amp;ldquo;Family&amp;rdquo;,&amp;ldquo;OldBlog&amp;rdquo;] I hate potty training. Jenny does, too, for the record. We&amp;rsquo;re no good at it. We rarely stay at home long enough to actually get our children into a rhythm of going every so often, we constantly forget to ask, and, well, it&amp;rsquo;s just pretty convenient to not have to worry about one of the four bladders in our posse at any given time of day.</description>
