Over the years, the Blogger platform has served me well. It has captured many memories that I enjoy reading and re-reading.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No, I&amp;rsquo;m not giving up blogging. In fact, I&amp;rsquo;m doubling down on it! I&amp;rsquo;m just giving up on Blogger. As I said, it has served me well, but my interests have moved on. I wanted something that I could have better control over, something I could call my own. Oh, and I already owned the DogsButtBrew.com domain name and was paying for hosting&amp;hellip; That site was in desperate need of a refresh. Combine that with a need to rejuvenate the blog, and you have the relaunched (DogsButtBrew.com)[http://dogsbuttbrew.com]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago (well, over a month ago now), we took a trip to Glenwood Springs, CO. It was a trip to celebrate the end of summer and to get away for a little bit before the kids started school the next week. It was a nice long weekend, though the traffic coming down from the mountains left little to be desired.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At a high level, we walked around, went on some long bike rides along the Colorado River, visited a wild west theme park on the top of a mountain, took a cave tour, and did the hike at Hanging Lake. For anybody looking to go to Hanging Lake, here are my recommendations:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>So... We moved to Colorado...</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In case you haven&amp;rsquo;t been following the blog&amp;hellip; Er, wait&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So we moved to Colorado. We&amp;rsquo;ve been eyeing a move up for awhile. This was the year to do it when Ethan was transitioning to High School and before Quin got too entrenched in his activities and the area. So we set out to do something new, and Colorado won out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The thing that allowed us to do all of this was a company that decided to hire me as, get this, the Executive Director of Technology. Cool title, eh? IQNavigator is the company, and by now I&amp;rsquo;ve been working there a little over 2 months.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This won&amp;rsquo;t really benefit Mireille, but a family in much the same situation we are in has started a fund to help bring food to orphans in need in Kinshasa. We&amp;rsquo;re planning on doing some fund raising to help this organization. Despite your feelings on international adoption, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to disagree with helping children to get nutritious food and water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please consider donating.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.congochildrensfund.org&#34;&gt;http://www.congochildrensfund.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;http://static.wixstatic.com/media/2b8a4c_f3dccf6904af4c35b80aec3d230e75d1.jpg_srz_640_314_75_22_0.50_1.20_0.00_jpg_srz&#34;&#xA;   height=400px &#xA;  &#xA;  /&gt;&#xA;  &lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;  &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;http://dogsbuttbrew.com/media/2b8a4c_f3dccf6904af4c35b80aec3d230e75d1.jpg_srz_640_314_75_22_0.50_1.20_0.00_jpg_srz&#34;&#xA;   height=400px &#xA;  &#xA;  /&gt;&#xA;  &lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;  &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;update&#34;&gt;Update&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;the video permissions have been changed and should work now. Thanks for your patience while I learn to use computers&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As my brother pointed out, my Congo posts came out with images that looked like they should be videos. They were supposed to be videos! I&amp;rsquo;ve gone through the lot and switched them out for YouTube videos where applicable. Please go through from Day 1 and see some motion you may not have seen the first time through! You should be able to navigate to the posts from the nav-menu on the right. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Great Congolese Caper - Day 8 - On the way home</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;kinshasa---day-7&#34;&gt;Kinshasa - Day 7&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My last day. I feel bad, but I was looking forward to this in some ways. Over the last 5 days, Mireille has turned into a typical 2 year old, and taking care of 2 year olds is HARD! Particularly by yourself. Luckily, when you have nothing else to do, it makes it much easier. It&amp;rsquo;s much easier to completely invest in what the child is saying and doing, which I did - once I got done showering, washing the dishes, and packing (I&amp;rsquo;m such an adult).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;kinshasa---day-6&#34;&gt;Kinshasa - Day 6&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Getting down to it! Today I&amp;rsquo;m nervous again, but that hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed much from day 1 here, or day -2 for that matter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last night started out rough. Mireille was restless. She didn&amp;rsquo;t fall out of bed, but was up like 3 times up until about 1:00 AM. She didn&amp;rsquo;t cry or anything, but she got out of bed and asked me to hold her. After rocking her to sleep the other two times, I convinced her to just sleep in my bed with me the last time. That ended up working very well. She settled down and was completely out in short order. Her only requirement seemed to be that she had one foot touching me somewhere. That forced me to settle down and not be so uptight and nervous as well, so we both got a good night&amp;rsquo;s sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;kinshasa---day-5&#34;&gt;Kinshasa - Day 5&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a hotel day - all day at the hotel. It&amp;rsquo;s a good and a bad thing. Getting out would be nice simply to stave off the boredom, but it also allows for a very concentrated, focused time for just hanging out with your child - something I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I ever did so much with the boys, or at the very least don&amp;rsquo;t do it anymore…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Great Congolese Caper - Day 5 - Kinshasa and Surrounding Areas</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;kinshasa---day-4&#34;&gt;Kinshasa - Day 4&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bad habits I&amp;rsquo;m already allowing my daughter to develop, because, hey, she&amp;rsquo;s under a lot of stress just hanging out with me. I hope I&amp;rsquo;m not setting myself up for bad things later:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Drinking soda - this is a big no-no for the sub-40ers in our household, but Mireille has already had soda every day I&amp;rsquo;ve been with her. She likes it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Not brushing her teeth - it&amp;rsquo;s difficult enough to get her to open her mouth for me, much less brush. She has finally started using the toothbrush herself, but she does a terrible job at brushing…&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Holding her until she sleeps - I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I broke my boys of this habit prior to them being 30 months old. I actually think it could be developmental progress in that she&amp;rsquo;s regressing to a more infant state. My guess is that she didn&amp;rsquo;t get a lot of personal attention as an infant, and perhaps craves it now. I&amp;rsquo;m happy to provide it, though it is frustrating at times to try to set her down and sneak away before she wakes up. Raising a two year old is hard!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today started out fairly badly again in that I just cannot seem to get to sleep at a reasonable time! Despite only getting 2 hours the night before plus a 2 hour nap, I still could not fall asleep until after 4:00 AM local time (9:00 Central, coincidentally). I imagine by the time I leave I will have adjusted better to the time change - just in time to screw it up again. At least there I will have full access to my modern diversions and drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Great Congolese Caper - Day 3 - Kinshasa</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;kinshasa---day-2&#34;&gt;Kinshasa - Day 2&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a rough night night, I managed to get up and get myself together by 9:00, when Papa John was schedule to show up so we could go grocery shopping. By the time he showed up, though, it was 10:30. Traffic… Common problem in Kinshasa! By then, we took off to ShopRite, a local, modern supermarket, where I purchased my groceries for the week. It was a little nerve wracking buying groceries for the week, let me tell you. Normally Jenny takes care of that kind of thing! I was very surprised at the selection, though. I managed to buy some fruit (bananas and grapes), eggs, butter, milk (which they store warm - weird), bread, sardines (Papa John insisted), cookies, and rice. Apparently a lot of the Congolese diet consists of rice dishes. Either that or “Foo-foo,” something I just learned of today from my new friend Andrew!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;kinshasa---day-3&#34;&gt;Kinshasa - Day 3&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today, I met my daughter! Yes, I met her yesterday, but that version of Mireille was guarded, afraid, and sullen. She&amp;rsquo;s asleep now - hopefully for the night. Today we made very good progress, and I am beyond excited!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The morning started out not so well. I slept terribly last night, by that I mean I didn&amp;rsquo;t really sleep at all. I fell asleep around 10:00, but Mireille fell out of bed at 10:45, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t sleep after that. I was worried about her, too many things going through my head… Every time she moved a little bit, I was up and on edge. So when 5:30 rolled around, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t very excited to hear her up, though I wasn&amp;rsquo;t surprised since she had been asleep since 6:00 the evening before!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;kinshasa---day-1---airport-to-the-hotel&#34;&gt;Kinshasa - Day 1 - Airport to the Hotel&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was happy when I landed in Paris that I finally got a text message back from my guide, Papa John. That made me feel much more comfortable about landing in Kinshasa, seeing as how I’ve read many bad stories about the experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is 6:30 local time on Sunday evening as I land, and it is completely dark already. Since I was in the middle of the plane, I didn’t get a good look at the landing, but what I could see, there didn’t seem to be too many lights.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Great Congolese Caper - Day 2 - Paris, France</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;paris---charles-de-gaul-airport&#34;&gt;Paris - Charles De Gaul Airport&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I landed around 8:00 local time in Charles De Gaul Airport outside of Paris, France. For my first trip to France, it was a little underwhelming. I suppose it’s true what they say that you don’t really visit a country when you visit the airport…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After disembarking my flight, I followed the hallways and signage to where my next flight was taking off, Terminal 2E the K gates (I think). I bought the AT&amp;amp;T Passport plan before taking off, which allows for free text messaging and reduced call rates via cell phone, so I attempted to text Jenny to let her know that I landed. While my texts successfully went through eventually, Jenny was unable to text me back due to some complications with switching between iMessage and SMS texting. This is something I need to take up with Apple at some point, because it took us four days to finally figure it out. For those that might suffer the same issue, you have to turn off iMessage on your sending phone, then remove any text conversations that are on the phone, then send a new text message to the phone number and not the e-mail address… What a pain!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;seat-9a-to-msp&#34;&gt;Seat 9a to MSP&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Leg one is done. Yes, the easiest leg, but significant nonetheless. My seat wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad - I was on the window next to an older woman who didn&amp;rsquo;t take up too much room, so that was good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Things I learned from this step of the journey:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;My earbuds suck. So much so that I have already replaced them with some cheap on ear headphones so I don&amp;rsquo;t have to monkey with them the whole time on the next two flights.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m too obsessed with food. Not knowing what the status of food on the upcoming flight is, I gorged myself at Charly&amp;rsquo;s Philly-style subs. Delicious, but didn&amp;rsquo;t need all that food! I think I&amp;rsquo;m afraid of starving in the next week and feel like I can stave it off by eating way too much before I go!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;rsquo;m sitting at gate G9 waiting for my next leg to board. Interesting room of people. Some people are clearly foreign, but it&amp;rsquo;s not super easy to determine. Going to be an interesting flight, but probably not quite as interesting as the next one!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m on the aisle in the middle section among the cattle again. The seat&amp;rsquo;s not bad, though there&amp;rsquo;s little leg room due to a heater or some box that is in my leg area. This is a cutting edge plane&amp;hellip; from the 90s. It has screens in each of the seatbacks that are touch sensitive (sort of) and retain the old 4:3 aspect ration. Didn&amp;rsquo;t matter - I slept for a couple of hours, woke up and watched Birdman (or most of it), then slept some more before watching the flight information channel as we descended to Kinshasa, where it was already dark by 6:30 when we landed… 1 Day down and I&amp;rsquo;ve seen very little sunlight!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As I sit here in General Mitchell International Airport, I am anxious and hopeful at what the next week will bring.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7dVvjWXROCU/VOlgHGKTOVI/AAAAAAAAkSg/gLq1pmincSM/s1600/IMG_1268.JPG&#34;&#xA;   height=400px &#xA;  &#xA;  /&gt;&#xA;  &lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;  &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&#xA;  &lt;img src=&#34;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Iv6YB9exWao/VOlgIKCrAmI/AAAAAAAAkSo/c3Tiry69eWg/s1600/IMG_7464.JPG&#34;&#xA;   height=400px &#xA;  &#xA;  /&gt;&#xA;  &lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;    &#xA;  &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re adopting a child from the Democratic Republic of Congo. Mireille is her name, and she is 2 and a half years old. She&amp;rsquo;s been our daughter by Congolese law for over 6 months, but politics and what appears to be corruption have prevented us from bringing her home to live with us in the U.S. One day, I&amp;rsquo;m sure that will happen, though that day is not today, nor is it this week. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m outing us to the world. Well, Jenny outed us on Facebook about a month ago, but this post makes it official - we are in the process of adopting a little girl from the Democratic Republic of Congo. In fact, we&amp;rsquo;ve been matched with our daughter for 18 months, and are in fact her legal parents by that country&amp;rsquo;s laws. In a very strange combination of power plays and international politics, however, we are unable to bring her home to the United States. What&amp;rsquo;s worse, we still have no idea when it might be that we will be able to bring her home. That aside, she is already starting to provide for some fun stories, which I always like to share.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quin loves pets. Ignore the fact that Heinz is our pet and he rarely is very nice to him. In fact, the nicest he typically is to him is when he ignores him. But if he finds a toad in the yard, or a stray bug on a window, he gets his ice cream pale, fills it with a little water and some leaves, and puts the poor thing in there until we force him to release the poor animal before they become a dead animal.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-circumcision&#34;&gt;The Circumcision&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This weekend, my brother-in-law turned 50 and we were invited to his party. On the 30 minute drive to his house, Jenny and I were behaving like the good parents that we are and allowing the kids to listen to the Comedy Central channel on Sirius Satellite Radio, something of which we are currently enjoying a free trial. The content on the station isn&amp;rsquo;t all that, well, appropriate, but we count on the kids not listening much like they don&amp;rsquo;t listen to us - ever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been awhile since I&amp;rsquo;ve written anything about Ethan. He&amp;rsquo;s getting older, as you might guess. It&amp;rsquo;s actually been quite shocking of late. In a year&amp;rsquo;s time he passed his mother up in height and weight and his voice has reached a near approximation of a man&amp;rsquo;s voice - a small man maybe, but a man&amp;rsquo;s voice nonetheless. His shoulders and arms bear resemblance to the Tibbett side I can only assume since they have grown muscular despite him not really doing much in the line of working them out, and he can grow a fair mustache. Sure it&amp;rsquo;s a little thin, but it&amp;rsquo;s facial hair. Not sure how I feel about our baby getting so big so quickly - he promises to pass me up in the next couple of years. I keep joking that I need to find ways to scare him in case he one day realizes that he could take me in a dual.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago I got an e-mail from an old co-worker who still worked at my old place of employment. It was a complimentary e-mail, fairly light in nature, which made it all the more mysterious why the e-mail header on my iPad read, &amp;ldquo;To: Big, Fat, and Stupid - From: &amp;lt;name omitted&amp;gt;&amp;rdquo;. Hmm&amp;hellip; I asked him why that was what he had called me in his address book and he claimed innocense. I figured somebody at my old job was probably playing a funny joke by getting one of the IT guys to mess with my name on the company mail server.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s right, we&amp;rsquo;re going a little Tarantino here with the time jumping and what-not. By now it&amp;rsquo;s been nearly two weeks and the scars are just starting to form. This will be a blissfully short retrospective on the fifth day of our summer vacation, lest it is lost for all time to the memory of the harrowing experience of the trip home.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Saturday was not at all unlike Friday in most regards. A quick breakfast at the hotel, stop at Starbucks, then off to Regis University for our second and final full day of camp activities. The format was much the same as the previous day - we dropped the kids off into their age banded groups then headed off to our adult talks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;9:30 on Monday, June 30, 2014. We&amp;rsquo;re all showered, Quin is in bed, Jenny&amp;rsquo;s powering through another bout with Facebook, I&amp;rsquo;m watching The Wolverine with Ethan&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s easy to forget about the events of the last 36 hours. It&amp;rsquo;s taken me an hour to type up the summary on this page, so I can only imagine how long the actual account will take me. This will be an epic, to be sure. It will only cover about 36 hours of actual time, but I fear it may take me almost that much time to condense my thoughts into the written word. I can promise you intrigue, adventure, horror, romance - well, maybe not romance, but it is quite a story. It will be long. I feel like Tolkien sitting down and recounting Bilbo&amp;rsquo;s trip back to The Shire. This could take a while, but hopefully it will not bore too much.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Friday started our first full day at camp. We had hoped to get a vacation run in this morning, but alas, it was not meant to be. We were able to get moving in time for our 8:30 breakfast meet-up for new families. New families were quite the thing this year with the camp doubling in size or so over the last couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After breakfast we dropped the kids off with their age appropriate groups, each color coded by shirt color. Quin&amp;rsquo;s group, the first graders, were colored red, and Ethan&amp;rsquo;s group, the middle schoolers, were colored tan. The separation ceremony was done in the gym along with some African dance being taught to us by a local troupe of African dancers. We, and most others, were predictably inept at dancing, though Quin made up for the rest of us. Ethan didn&amp;rsquo;t care to have any of us around him for the separation ceremony, but we could see him from across the gym and he looked typically uncomfortable, though he was trying, it was clear.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year&amp;rsquo;s edition of summer vacation is to the Mile High City where we are attending an African and Caribbean Heritage Camp. It&amp;rsquo;s been a few years since we&amp;rsquo;ve been in Denver in the summer, so we were pretty excited to get things started.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The plan was to make the 15 hour drive from Tuesday through Wednesday morning. After 2/3 day of work, we packed up the car and&amp;hellip; waited for Target to deliver some new patio furniture. That could have probably been planned better. They gave us a window from 2-6 on Tuesday. Luckily they turned up at 5:00. It seemed a little sketchy - they showed up in a Penske rental truck and had the back full of stuff. I don&amp;rsquo;t recall if they had uniforms on. Very strange.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Raining again this morning. As we were packing our room, I was thinking on my post from last night and how I had forgotten to put some important color on it. After the mall, the three boys (Ethan, Quin, and Loudon) and I went swimming in the pool. After we had swum for awhile, a couple of young girls came in - I would estimate they were around 10 or 11 years old. At one point they went to sit in the hot tub, where Quin followed them. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even notice he was gone&amp;hellip; I was hanging with my nepphew, trying to show him how to float. A couple of minutes later, Quin comes jumping into the regular pool and asks me, quiely, &amp;ldquo;dad, where do we live?&amp;rdquo; I told him Oconomowoc, and he got out of the pool and went back to the hot tub. A couple of minutes later he did the same thing, this time asking what state we lived in&amp;hellip; Then went back&amp;hellip; It was kind of spooky how natural he was at working these two girls - I was at once impressed and taking notes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The day started REALLY late this morning. The plan was to meet Uncle Bryce and Loudon at the Mall of America (MOA) at 10:00 to do rides and other fun stuff. When 9:00 rolled around and we were still having difficulty getting Quin out of bed, we knew we were going to have to delay a bit. It seems that vacation finally caught up to the 6 year old, who went to bed at midnight the night previous and hadn&amp;rsquo;t slept much to date. He sure made up for it last night!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ethan and I knocked one of our meager goals for this vacation off this morning, we had breakfast at Taco Bell! Yeah, we have lofty goals. We piled down a couple of waffle tacos and breakfast burritos each and headed into St. Paul to take in the Minnesota Museum of Science.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The MMS is one of the better science museums I&amp;rsquo;ve been to, quite honestly. We easily spent 3.5 hours there without even doing a movie! This included the dinosaur exhibit, which was very cool. I learned some interesting new things, in fact. I had no idea what a rennaissance of dinosaur discoveries we were in lately! I don&amp;rsquo;t think I recognized a single dino in the exhibit, they were all new discoveries in the last 10 years or so. My favorite was an entire new class of dinosaurs, the &amp;ldquo;titanosaurs.&amp;rdquo; Very cool name.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We departed Neillsville sometime between 9:00 and 10:00 AM, right on schedule. Jenny&amp;rsquo;s plans didn&amp;rsquo;t have us overtaxing ourselves today. The plan was to hit a couple of tourist stops south of the Twin Cities, then drive up to spend the late afternoon/evening at Blaine&amp;rsquo;s in Inver Grove Heights.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our first stop was at (LARK Toys)[http://www.larktoys.com/] in Kellogg Minnesota. This was not our typical drive for a vacation as it involved ZERO interstate time. Highway 10 to Mondovi, then meandered south to the river, across the river, you get the picture. It was picturesque, or would have been if there had been any leaves on the trees. We stopped in Mondovi for a soda as we were parched, and were surprised at how WARM it was outside! I think it&amp;rsquo;s been so long since we&amp;rsquo;ve felt warm air that we didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to respond, but the day was beautiful!!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Grady Spring Break, 2014! The itenerary is quite extensive, to be sure, and the destinations exotic!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The trip started yesterday where we left the house in the van around 9:00 AM, heading north! Yes, you read that correctly, we headed NORTH for spring break. Didn&amp;rsquo;t say we were all that bright! The first stop was probably just off of MTV&amp;rsquo;s list of destinations for this year&amp;rsquo;s spring break, Neillsville, WI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was Saturday. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember many of the details of the day, unfortunately, but what I do remember is that we got the call that the birth mother had finally completed the harrowing experience of giving birth to who would come to be our child through the institution of domestic adoption. Over the years we&amp;rsquo;ve found that we&amp;rsquo;ve been given the gift of a wonderful, healthy, smart, and strong boy with whom we get to spend time with, learn from, be perplexed and frustrated by, and love on a day to day basis. It&amp;rsquo;s been a wild ride and I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to find out what&amp;rsquo;s next!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the new year! With a new year comes a renewed hope that I will actually keep this thing up to date. Here goes this week&amp;rsquo;s attempt!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quin continues to grow up fast. Despite that, he still has the occasional accident at night where he wets his bed - and when he does, he wets it epically (his word). So we typically put him in a pull-up in the evening, which he takes like a good sport. A couple of mornings ago, I had just gotten done going for a run and was getting ready to take a shower. In our house, modesty is laughed at, so I was trekking from my bedroom to the bathroom, where Quin was using the toilet, without any clothing on. Since I had just gotten done running, I had the imprint of my elastic band shorts around my waist. Quin took a look at me, unfazed by the fact that I was completely nude, and gave me a concerned look. He pointed and said, &amp;ldquo;that hurts, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it!&amp;rdquo; I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what he was talking about, so I pressed him for details. He pointed at the imprint of my elastic band shorts and said, &amp;ldquo;there, where your pullup was. That hurts. I know!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We just got back from a vacation in our nation&amp;rsquo;s capital. This post is not about that, however, but I wanted to warn you that an update&amp;rsquo;s coming about that in the coming days/weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A couple of quick ones, though. First, Ethan has had a couple of milestones in the last few weeks. As a seventh grader, Ethan decided he was going to run for his school&amp;rsquo;s student council as the vice president. At first he was quite excited as he thought he was running unopposed. In the days after deciding to run, however, he found out that he would have an opponent after all - and worse yet, he was running against an eighth grade girl. Undeterred he crafted a speech and started a social media campaign (OK, I&amp;rsquo;m exaggerating about the social media campaign, but that would have been cool) and ended up winning the post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t blogged in awhile. Part of it is sheer laziness. That compounds on itself in that there are just too many things to blog about so I just can&amp;rsquo;t find the time to get it done. I&amp;rsquo;m in that situation right now. But something happened a couple of weeks ago that was too funny not to document - so here goes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We went to Noah&amp;rsquo;s Ark - America&amp;rsquo;s Largest Waterpark - last week for a last ditch summer celebration. To set the tone (since I can&amp;rsquo;t tell a short story), I am building a deck, and had the guy coming out to auger the holes for the footings in the morning. My assumption was that he was going to be there for about an hour, from 8:00 until 9:00 or so, then we would leave after that. Well, that didn&amp;rsquo;t exactly happen as planned. He was there for almost 2.5 hours, and the fun vacation day to the Dells started out with one very angry wife.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;hes-on-fire&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s On Fire!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I was in college, one of my favorite games on the Sega Genesis was NBA Jam. It was great. You could crank out a game in 15 minutes, everybody could play, and best of all, most of the time, I would win. A couple of weekends ago I got nostalgic. Ethan has all sorts of time to play all these complicated games. I want nothing more than to do that, but have other priorities than an 11 year old boy does (getting old sucks). I figured, though, that I could still play NBA Jam - it fits into my schedule, it&amp;rsquo;s family friendly, and it is cheap.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

His prescription is very mild - he only needs them for class, pretty much, not for sports or basically anything else. But it has begun. Later this year we will probably be putting him in braces (for his teeth, not his legs). Get in line, ladies!!!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a running joke with the boys. Any time they ask me a question that begs me to define reasons for behavior, I like to answer, &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;cause I like to party.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s a brilliant quote from Talladega Nights - if you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar, check it out here:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;&#xA;      &lt;iframe allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen&#34; loading=&#34;eager&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/SS_OVZtVa4E?autoplay=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;end=0&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;mute=0&amp;amp;start=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#xA;    &lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, like most things I&amp;rsquo;d prefer they didn&amp;rsquo;t, both boys have started using it in daily conversations, with improving timing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;adoption&#34;&gt;Adoption&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s all begun again. Jenny and I have started pursuing another adoption, this time an international one through the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire). So far much has been the same as last time around - filling out paperwork, background checks, talking about my feelings - fun stuff. We&amp;rsquo;re getting to the point where we will be having a social worker come to the house to interview us, so we were explaining to Quinton what we were doing. Jenny explained it to him that he was going to have a new brother. He looked very confused and concerned and asked her, &amp;ldquo;is Ethan leaving?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last weekend was the annual &amp;ldquo;Tri-ing for Children&amp;rsquo;s Triathlon,&amp;rdquo; a weekend long set of triathlons to benefit Children&amp;rsquo;s Hospital here in town. Jenny and I were both signed up to do the sprint triathlon, a 1/4 mile swim, 15 mile bike, then 3.1 mile run. We&amp;rsquo;ve done it a few years in a row now, so that&amp;rsquo;s not what I&amp;rsquo;m writing about - this year we decided to let our kids participate in the kid&amp;rsquo;s event on the Saturday prior to the adult races.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever heard the &amp;ldquo;Little Johnny&amp;rdquo; jokes? For several reasons, I have a feeling that they might one day be replaced by &amp;ldquo;Little Quinny&amp;rdquo; jokes. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of one - Little Johnny was in class learning his ABCs. The teacher was asking the class to name something with each letter of the alphabet in order. Little Johnny raised his hand for each letter, but she kept skipping him thinking that he would say something bad, like &amp;ldquo;ass&amp;rdquo; for A and &amp;ldquo;butt&amp;rdquo; for B. Finally, she had gotten all the way to R. Little Johnny dutifully raised his hand while nobody else did. She figured, &amp;ldquo;what could he say that is naughty that starts with R?&amp;rdquo; So she called on Little Johnny. Little Johnny immediately said, &amp;ldquo;Rats!&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Oh, that&amp;rsquo;s nice,&amp;rdquo; the teacher said, relieved. &amp;ldquo;No, Rats, with big penises!&amp;rdquo; Little Johnny followed up immediately&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quin and I were at home together the other day - I can&amp;rsquo;t remember why. Jenny and Ethan were out somewhere, I think to get Ethan a haircut. We opened the garage and heard something flying around in there. Before long, Quin had spotted the culprit - a bird had gotten itself stuck in the garage. He was having a hard time finding his way out, and Quin was enthralled! I went into the house and started putting things away from my day&amp;rsquo;s work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We had the opportunity to travel to Spread Eagle, WI near Iron Mountain, MI for Memorial Day this year. A friend of ours works for a company that owns a &amp;ldquo;cabin&amp;rdquo; on a lake up there, which they allow their employees to rent by the week during the year. When say cabin, I mean a 5 bedroom, 4000 square foot, modern home that is situated on a lake up north. So we joined 3 other families up there for the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My boys really don&amp;rsquo;t think much, normally, before a Hallmark Holiday like Mother&amp;rsquo;s Day. Last night, however, Ethan asked me (discretely) what mom&amp;rsquo;s favorite breakfast was. I told him that she liked an egg over easy with toast. He nodded, then said that he&amp;rsquo;d like to make that for her in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So this morning, Quin (and I, I suppose) woke up a little after 6:00. He watched Garfield while I watched the inside of my eyelids for an hour more. Around 7:45, I heard Jenny stirring, watching TV in the bedroom. After another 15 minutes, I went upstairs to wake up my tweenager who had only 10 hours of sleep at that point, and told him it was time. He asked me what to do, and I told him. While Ethan was frying the egg, Quin made and buttered toast. Ethan got the egg just right on the first try, impressively! Quin then put a carnation in his teeth and carried the plate while Ethan poured some orange juice in a glass and delivered it to mom for mother&amp;rsquo;s day! I have no idea how it tasted, but Jenny ate it all up, so either it tasted fine, or she is just a good mom - I suppose it could be both&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had an interesting experience as a parent last night and had to share it with the world, because that&amp;rsquo;s what we do in the day and age of over sharing&amp;hellip; Ethan has a test in Social Studies today. They are covering early history of the United states, from Washington&amp;rsquo;s presidency through the war of 1812. As an aside, I make a way better fifth grader as a 39 year old than I ever did as a 10 year old&amp;hellip; That is to say that this information is way more interesting to me today than it ever was 30 years ago. So the way I quiz him is I go through and read the chapters while picking out what I think are key details of the chapters. To my delight, we were talking about Daniel Boone and the Westward Expansion, Louisiana Purchase, etc., and we got to a quote that is credited to DB himself when asked why he continued to move west until his dying day, which was (I&amp;rsquo;m paraphrasing), &amp;ldquo;I need some elbow room.&amp;rdquo; That, of course, made me think back to Saturday morning cartoon interludes from our friends at School House Rock. Since I had my laptop sitting right next to me, I quickly searched for the video and was rewarded with the 3 minutes and 10 seconds of goodness that I remembered. I quickly brought it up and let Ethan watch it. I now share it with you for nostalgia&amp;rsquo;s sake:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-big-update&#34;&gt;The Big Update&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, for the prerequisite apology. My wife and my mother both have scolded me for not having an update out here for going on 2 months now, so here is the big update.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;quin-does-music&#34;&gt;Quin Does Music&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the last 2 months, Quin has put his musical skills on display. He enjoys listening to music on his CD player in his room - last night he told his babysitter all about the music player he had in his room with at least 10 CDs! He also told her that he had a really big bed. Something tells me that he is starting to develop his pickup lines early. Anyway, he loves listening to all kinds of music, but some of his favorites are &amp;ldquo;Sexy and I Know It&amp;rdquo; by LMFAO (he sings it &amp;ldquo;Sexxies and I Know It&amp;rdquo;) and &amp;ldquo;Moves Like Jagger&amp;rdquo; by Marroon 5, which Quin sings &amp;ldquo;Moves like Quinton.&amp;rdquo; His moves are not to be taken lightly. He very much enjoys doing &amp;ldquo;The Booty Dance&amp;rdquo; for us (sorry, I don&amp;rsquo;t have a video), particularly when Ethan is showing us some of his moves. More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s tough for me to write today because my favorite group of millionaires lost to somebody else&amp;rsquo;s favorite group of millionaires in a game I was sure would go my millionaire&amp;rsquo;s way. Oh well, we must persevere!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a typical busy couple of weeks. Today was one of Ethan&amp;rsquo;s last functions as a Cub Scout, the Pinewood Derby. For most kids this is an exciting event, but for Ethan and I, we sort of dread it. Neither Ethan or I really understand what it takes to build a &amp;ldquo;good car.&amp;rdquo; Our cars generally make it to the end of the track, but rarely very fast, and always much slower than most other cars. After the first year of innocence where we thought we could possibly achieve a place, we settled into the common goal of not finishing last. Last year we only achieved that goal by 1 or 2 places, and that was in the overall results, not just within our den! So it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too shocking this year when Ethan told me that he didn&amp;rsquo;t even want to make a car. Since I&amp;rsquo;m a den leader, though, I was bullied into pressuring him into making a car, so we did, but we did the barest minimum of work on it. No cuts, he wrapped it in a car wrapper purchased from the local hobby shop, we sanded and polished the axles and wheels like we&amp;rsquo;ve heard you should, and finally finished up the car on Saturday night. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t much to look at, but it at least went straight!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The last day of vacation is always the dreaded travel day. We were lucky enough to be able to get some laundry done at mom and dad&amp;rsquo;s before we left (OK, Jenny got it done), so we (Jenny) would not have to do it when we (Jenny) got home. But travel days are always a pain. Most of the morning was spent biding time until our flight. We departed pretty early for the airport - we had a 1:00 flight and arrived at the airport at 11:00, so we had plenty of time to get some pizza and wait at the gate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Great West Adventure - Day 8 - Don&#39;t look down...</title>
      <link>http://dogsbuttbrew.com/reclaimed/great-west-adventure---day-8---dont-look-down.../</link>

      <guid>http://dogsbuttbrew.com/reclaimed/great-west-adventure---day-8---dont-look-down.../</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Day 8 was to be a relaxing day! In that right, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t too bad. Mom and dad wanted to show off their new winter home state to us, though, so we headed out of town on Arizona 88 around 10:30 to catch up on some history and engineering marvels. Our first stop was Tortilla Flat, a (very) small stop on the way up to the Roosevelt Dam on the Salt River. What might be said about Tortilla Flat is that it is the last sane place to stop on Hwy 88 before you wish you had brought a dune buggy! After spending a short time in Tortilla Flat getting a beer and looking through some of the buildings, we headed out again on 88 with a destination of the Roosevelt Dam. 88, however, was the real attraction of today&amp;rsquo;s trip. All along my dad was explaining to me how horrendous this road was, and let me drive to prove it to me. Of course I didn&amp;rsquo;t really take this all that seriously - he&amp;rsquo;s old, right!? Well, let me be the first to admit that this is far and away the nastiest drive I&amp;rsquo;ve taken in all my years. Not only is it a curvy, mountainous road with little or not shoulder or barrier between the road and the canyon floor many hundreds of feet down, but the road is unpaved and, seemingly, ribbed (for her pleasure). I&amp;rsquo;m not sure of the science behind dirt roads and why they get so bumpy, but this one seemed to have been made so on purpose, perhaps to keep people from going more than about 15 miles per hour. Anyway, our 28 mile trek from Tortilla Flat to Roosevelt Dam took well over an hour. We did stop for some lunch along the way at Apache Lake where Quin started out napping, and upon waking half way through the meal asked us &amp;ldquo;where is everybody?&amp;rdquo; Business was not bustling in Apache Lake today!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There was no plan in the works for today other than to drive back to Phoenix at some point. Small portion of the day, only 6.5 hours&amp;hellip; Surprisingly, though, it seemed relaxed since we didn&amp;rsquo;t have an itinerary. So we started out the day like we did any other day on vacation, we ate at a local breakfast establishment. This time we found a local favorite, Panera Bread. Excellent bagels and sandwiches - oh who am I kidding, we just wanted something fast.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Great West Adventure - Day 6 - It&#39;s a zoo out there</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In case there was any question to the subtitle of yesterday&amp;rsquo;s post, we were watching the weather where the cute weather lady exclaimed that the clouds were pretty moist and deep, and that she wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be surprised to see them start to rain at any time. I found that amusing - I suppose I&amp;rsquo;ve never really progressed past the age of 12 as far as my maturity level goes&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I again find myself 3 days tardy in posting this, so I think this will be pretty short. Today was about the zoo. The day started out a bit earlier than any of us would have liked. Around 6:25 AM, the hotel&amp;rsquo;s fire alarm system started going crazy. We awoke in a daze, but figured out what was going on well enough to put some clothes on, grab our &amp;ldquo;necessities,&amp;rdquo; (my wallet and keys to the car - oh, and the kids), and get outside. We weren&amp;rsquo;t outside more than a couple of minutes before they gave us the all clear stating that it was a false alarm. No kidding&amp;hellip; By this time, Quin was finally starting to wake up. As I was holding him in my arms, he took his head off my shoulder, looked up at me and said, &amp;ldquo;please I push the button?&amp;rdquo; Apparently to a kid of three, pushing the elevator button is pretty much the coolest thing you could ever hope to do. The entire week he would dash to the elevator anytime we hinted at going up or down in it. Ethan caught on, being the mean big brother, and taunted him at every turn, threatening to push the button instead of him, sometimes succeeding. Of course, being the opportunistic parents that we are, we used it as leverage to get Quin to do the things we wanted him to do. So, whenever we were heading to the elevator, he would ask us if he could be the one to push the button&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Man, I have to start doing these as they happen. This is my third log today!!! To get me through it, I&amp;rsquo;ve gone to the fridge to finish off my San Diego brew sampler with a Karl Strauss Brewing Company Boardwalk Black Rye. Tasty!!!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s plan was to go to Seaworld. We figured we would do things a little differently today since we completely missed supper yesterday, so we opted for a smaller breakfast of Subway sandwiches and Starbucks. After breakfast we headed north to Seaworld, San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Day 4 - San Diego. Today started out early with Quin waking around 6:00 - he&amp;rsquo;s getting better. He and I passed time playing iOS games on the iPhone and iPad in the second room of our suite while Jenny and Ethan grabbed 90 more minutes of sleep. By 7:30, Jenny got up and I hit the road for a quick run along the water.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By 9:00 we were off for a full day of vacationing. We decided to load up on breakfast since our plans for the day included Legoland, and our guess was that food would be somewhat expensive there. So I mapped out Perry&amp;rsquo;s Cafe near the freeway where we all ate enough to skip the next several meals - well, I did anyway! Delicious!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since we were up by 6:00 anyway, we decided to try to get an early start at things, so we got ready and left by 8:00. My parents graciously lent us their vehicle - they are currently going without any sort of motorized vehicle of their own, relying instead on pedal power and favors from friends - so we loaded it up and took off on our 6 and 1/2 hour drive to San Diego. Before we left town we had to make a quick stop at Starbucks to get Jenny her vacation nectar, Tall non-fat Chai Tea Latte, and at the gas station for a Pepsi Max for me - it&amp;rsquo;s not a diet soda, it&amp;rsquo;s a zero calorie soda for &lt;em&gt;men&lt;/em&gt;! At one point, Quinton asked &amp;ldquo;where are we going?&amp;rdquo; I explained we were going to Starbucks to get mommy a coffee - he responded, &amp;ldquo;oh darn it, I wanted to go to California.&amp;rdquo; I need to take this opportunity to say that the gas station/car wash/oil change establishment at the intersection of Highway 60 and Signal Butte Drive in Apache Junction is perhaps the most beautiful gas station I&amp;rsquo;ve ever encountered. From the clean, modern, southwest exterior, to the wide aisles, copious beverage choice, leather chairs, high definition televisions while you wait&amp;hellip; It was spectacular!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As should probably be expected, since Quin went to bed at around 6:00 local time, he woke up around 4:30 local. I suppose the day was going to start early! We aimed to do quite a bit during this day, but ultimately decided to back it off a bit seeing as how we were still a bit groggy from the previous day&amp;rsquo;s travels. We did manage to get to the (Superstition Mountain Museum)[http://www.superstitionmountainmuseum.org/] which is the site of an old Hollywood set for westerns which only recently burned to the ground. We also spent some time at (Goldfield Ghost Town)[http://www.superstitionmountainmuseum.org/] where we got to see a gunfight, Ethan bought a cowboy hat, and we ended up taking in some old west entertainment at the Saloon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;3:45 AM - the alarm called out the start of our Great West Adventure. We were ticketed for a 7:00 departure from Milwaukee&amp;rsquo;s General Mitchell Airport. With 3 and 10 year old in tow, we didn&amp;rsquo;t want to leave anything to risk. So we all showered the night before, set the alarm for 3:45, and aimed to leave by 4:15.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The plan went off without a hitch - the crew was excited for the trip. We pulled into our offsite parking lot at 5:10, plenty of time to spare. I suppose we could have probably slept a little longer, but who knows on a work day how bad traffic will get. After a quick shuttle ride we were at the ticketing counter, then off to the gate to meet up with our first trip on Southwest Airlines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Four years ago I ran in my first organized race since I graduated from high school when I participated in a sprint level triathlon. Since then I got in shape, got out of shape, lost 30 pounds, and have been in pretty decent shape since then. I&amp;rsquo;ve also managed to run in a half marathon, 2-200 mile relays, a number of 5Ks, 10Ks, a 20K, trail runs, road runs, you name it. After all of these races, my last two have been the most enjoyable for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Heinz comes to us from Little Buddies Rescue where he was dropped off from a puppy mill. We originally went there intending to adopt his sister, but she had already been spoken for by the time we got there. No worries! Heinz immediately endeared himself to us by fetching a toy for Ethan - a sure way to his heart! He had to stay at the rescue for a few more days so he could be neutered and have his initial vaccinations, so we went and picked him up yesterday. Unfortunately Ethan is up north spending some time with his grandparents, so he was not here to help us bring Heinz home. Quinton has been a lot of help, though! He was so impressed yesterday by the decrease in attention that he pooped his pants!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Neither Jenny nor I are very good about creating content for a baby book. In fact, I know I could not tell you where either of my children&amp;rsquo;s baby books are - perhaps in the top of our closet collecting dust. To capture memories, though, I&amp;rsquo;ve turned to this &amp;lsquo;blog. It worked out pretty well with Ethan so far, and Quinton has been no different. This post, then, is going to be some quick hitters to get into Quinton&amp;rsquo;s virtual baby book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Buyer Beware</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of weeks ago I ran a Webelos Scout Camp for Ethan and his Cub Scout cohorts (I know, the scouts are an intolerant bunch, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to affect Ethan&amp;rsquo;s learning - let&amp;rsquo;s keep this among adults, shall we). The camp was pretty enjoyable - the boys were tasked with setting up the tents and camp themselves, had to take part in meal prep and cleanup, etc. Part of each camp is doing some kind of craft. After observing how crazy the kids went for this Indian neck thing they made at the winter camp, I thought it would be fun to do some kind of craft where the kids could make something and take it home with them - something they could wear. I came across &amp;ldquo;Paracord Survival Bracelets&amp;rdquo; through my searching, which turned out to be right up their alley. A week or so before the camp, I practiced by making one for myself, then I showed Ethan how to do it. After about 5 minutes he had picked it up, and about 10 - 15 bracelets later, he had decided that he was going into business!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cars 2 is out! We&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting for awhile for this event as I had unofficially earmarked it as the first movie I would attempt to take Quinton to. I&amp;rsquo;m happy to report that there was nothing out of the ordinary that happened&amp;hellip; Yeah, boring blog post, but I&amp;rsquo;ll take it. I&amp;rsquo;d say he was as good as, if not a little better than Ethan when we took him to his first movie (I don&amp;rsquo;t recall which movie that was right now).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The other day, Jenny wanted me to burn a DVD for her to give to a person at church. I told her no problem, grabbed a blank DVD which I promptly attempted to insert into my Mac superdrive. I was somewhat surprised to find that I could not put the DVD into the drive, however. The computer did not say there was anything in the drive&amp;hellip; Quite strange, I thought. I suppose that there could be a disc in there that the OS didn&amp;rsquo;t know about somehow, a computer glitch. So I went to &amp;ldquo;the Google&amp;rdquo; and researched how to force the Mac DVD drive to eject. Having found my solution, I executed it according to instructions. The drive whined and made that mechanical eject noise, but no DVD appeared.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;File this one under TMI (that&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;too much information&amp;rdquo; for those not in the know). I believe I&amp;rsquo;ve discussed how Quin and I have pee races in this blog in the past. On Friday I went on a field trip with Ethan, and to make a very long story much shorter, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much to drink during the day. When I got home, Quin wanted to have a pee race. While we were racing, I said, &amp;ldquo;wow, daddy&amp;rsquo;s pee smells bad&amp;rdquo; (I told you this was too much information - you had been warned). Quin leaned forward and sniffed and said, &amp;ldquo;Yeah, it does. You need a new penis daddy. A black one!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My son is 10 years old! It&amp;rsquo;s tough really to get my head around that fact. I can only imagine what it is like for my parents to think about each year one of their aging children reaches another annual milestone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;9 was a pretty good year. Ethan&amp;rsquo;s shown a lot of improvement in school, thanks to his mother&amp;rsquo;s constant prodding and encouragement, he&amp;rsquo;s begun to really shine at the piano, and is starting to show real promise at soccer. I&amp;rsquo;m not saying that he&amp;rsquo;s looking like he may be Pele one day, but considering our dismay at his total lack of competitiveness or energy in previous years, this year has been one of wonder! It&amp;rsquo;s hard not to have high, unreasonable expectations of your kids. Lord knows how badly we&amp;rsquo;ve screwed him up already. Well, I suppose we get pretty good contact with him for the next 8 years or so (man, is it that few?!?!!), hopefully we don&amp;rsquo;t mess it up even worse than we have&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quinton has experimented with lots of different ways to express his anger with people when they don&amp;rsquo;t do things he likes. Initially he liked to call people &amp;ldquo;poopy butt,&amp;rdquo; but we quickly tried to squash that. He then moved on to calling people &amp;ldquo;stupid,&amp;rdquo; which I think I like worse than poopy-butt. Lately he has categorized you as either his friend or not his friend. If he likes you particularly, or if he wants something from you, he tells you, &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;re my best friend (he pronounces it fwond).&amp;rdquo; If, on the other hand, you tell him that he cannot have a candy bar after he hasn&amp;rsquo;t eaten his supper, he says, &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;re not my friend, Ethan&amp;rsquo;s my friend.&amp;rdquo; Of course, he will pick whoever else is around at the time, but you get the picture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>More Adventures with Potty Training</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So - potty training boys&amp;hellip; Yeah&amp;hellip; Well, we&amp;rsquo;re still doing pretty well, but something new has reared its ugly head. Now that Quin knows when he has to go to the bathroom, and no longer does it in his pants, he has decided that he wants to find other things to pee on other than the toilet. Jenny caught him peeing in the bathtub the other day. Yesterday I stopped him from going in the garbage can and in the refrigerator, while Jenny caught him trying to spray down the plunger in the bathroom. I have to admit, I didn&amp;rsquo;t see this one coming. Oh, the joys of raising boys!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Boy, a week makes a big difference. As of today, Quin is a week without diapers (while conscious). Last Saturday, Quin finally decided that he really, REALLY wanted to wear his light-up shoes all the time. He woke up on Saturday morning and told me, &amp;ldquo;daddy, I want my light-up shoes.&amp;rdquo; I told him that he had to wear underwear if he wanted to do that, and he thought that was OK. Since then, it&amp;rsquo;s been pretty much smooth sailing. Sure, he had a couple of minor slips the first couple of days, but overall it&amp;rsquo;s been outstanding! On Sunday morning when he woke up, Jenny went upstairs to find him sitting on the toilet &lt;em&gt;pinching a loaf&lt;/em&gt;, so to speak. In fact, most mornings now when he gets up, the first thing he does is strip down and put something else on so he can wear his light-up shoes. One night I caught him with his shoes in bed with him! It&amp;rsquo;s kind of nice that we really don&amp;rsquo;t need to do a lot of potty training, we just have to find a bribe worthy of our kids training themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I hate potty training. Jenny does, too, for the record. We&amp;rsquo;re no good at it. We rarely stay at home long enough to actually get our children into a rhythm of going every so often, we constantly forget to ask, and, well, it&amp;rsquo;s just pretty convenient to not have to worry about one of the four bladders in our posse at any given time of day. That said, we have (finally) started attempting some degree of potty training with Quin&amp;hellip; It&amp;rsquo;s not going so well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tuesday was another ski day. This time it was adult ski day. Quin was going back to school, and Ethan was enrolled in Woodward, an indoor extreme ski and snowboard school. The warehouse is immense with fake snow ramps that empty into foam pits and trampoline sections to teach people how to tumble with ease through the air. I think Ethan was in for a fun day!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ethan and I went down to Woodward to drop him off while Jenny dropped Quin off at school. Apparently this day wasn&amp;rsquo;t as easy to drop off as the previous - Quin really didn&amp;rsquo;t want to go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;OK, I hope this goes away like almost all other things, because if it comes back and is something serious, I will look like a schmuck. But Ethan had his little spell with sickness yesterday, during which he thought he was going to throw up. He is a fan of the drama! Today, he has a low grade headache as far as I can tell, because he&amp;rsquo;s running around, tubing, and being a general 9 year old menace, but after sitting on the couch for 30 minutes drinking water and eating popcorn he started complaining of a headache again. He stood in the kitchen, looked at me, and said, &amp;ldquo;I hope this isn&amp;rsquo;t something serious. It probably is, though. I&amp;rsquo;ve had a headache for 2 days now - that&amp;rsquo;s not normal, dad!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I sit here in our rented condo, Ethan and Jenny are sitting on the couch studying social studies (Jenny struggles, so they need to study), Quin is watching Monsters, Inc. on the iPad, it is brisk and snowing outside while the gas fire burns warmly in the fireplace. Our first ski vacation in 7 years is in full swing!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This vacation finds us in the beautiful US Rocky Mountains outside of Denver, CO. Though we&amp;rsquo;re already settled and active in our vacation activities, the trip started many days ago. Last Wednesday to be exact. We had settled down for a typical evening at home - Quin and Ethan were sleeping soundly in their beds while Jenny and I attempted to get some last minute television in before our whirlwind trip to Colorado. All seemed normal, that is until 10:30 when Quin called out from upstairs. It&amp;rsquo;s not atypical for him to wake up from time to time, particularly early in the evening. I slowly made my way upstairs to check on him. As I started walking down the hall, the door to his room opened and he walked out, covered in vomit. Awesome! Here we were, less than 48 hours from leaving for our trip, and Quin had come down with the flu! He was up the better part of the night, mostly dry heaving as he had done a pretty good job of emptying his stomach on round 1.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ethan belongs to the ski club at school.  Last week we went skiing for the first time this year.  Since Alpine is close to some friends of ours, we were able to meet up with them and their two kids, one of which, Justin, is Ethan&amp;rsquo;s age.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Justin and Ethan were having a blast!  Justin snow boards, but Ethan skied.  Of course, as soon as he saw Justin snow boarding, he immediately wanted to try that.  Jenny tried to convince him that he would want to do that prior to us going, but he didn&amp;rsquo;t want to until he saw Justin doing it&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

So much to talk about!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, it started a few weeks ago with Quin getting sick. The sickness eventually spread throughout the house but Quin got it first. The poor guy was just listless, throwing up, no fever, but sick. Every time he threw up over the course of several hours he just did it over the bucket, no crying or anything.  He was fine the next day, but now he constantly tells us that he&amp;rsquo;s going to go &amp;ldquo;throw up.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My relationship with my oldest son seems to be changing quite rapidly of late.  This morning after getting out of the shower I noticed a can of Axe body spray sitting on the sink intended for me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me rewind a little bit - over the past couple of months it has become evident to us that we had &amp;ldquo;the stinky kid&amp;rdquo; in school.  Ethan would get into the car, or just walk near us, and you could certainly tell he was there!  Not wanting to be the parents with the stinky kid in school, we racked our brains to fix the problem.  We tried buying him deodorant, we tried making him scrub extra hard on his every other day shower, but nothing seemed to really be working.  Finally, fed up, Jenny laid down the law and mandated daily showers along with a strict regiment of male fragrances.  He was resistant at first, but eventually he came around, so now he is a daily showerer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quinny and I played &amp;ldquo;monsters&amp;rdquo; tonight.  That little boy has quite an imagination.  First he pestered me until I came to &amp;ldquo;play me.&amp;rdquo;  So I followed him upstairs where he declared that he saw a monster.  For the next 30 minutes we were hiding, kicking, and even kissing the poor monster until his daddy put him to bed (both monsters).  Good times&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was windy and cool today, and I am training for a 1/2 marathon, so I picked today to do my long run of the week.  I mapped out a route before we left that took me around the entire lake.  While I was supposed to run only 10 miles, the prospect and symmetry of running around the entire lake was too good to pass up, so Tim Z. and I ended up running a little over 11.5 miles.  It took us a long time, and it was hilly, but we did it.  I now feel I&amp;rsquo;m ready for the 1/2 in a little over a week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Still a little cool to start the day, so Quin and I made bacon and egg sandwiches for breakfast before we headed out fishing with Tim and Logan Ziegler.  The fishing wasn&amp;rsquo;t all that great, but we did have a close encounter with an eagle.  It was pretty awesome, actually.  We heard something heavy in the trees, then the eagle flew just above the water not more than about 20 feet from the boat.  He skimmed the water across the lake, picked something up, then reversed his path and came right back past us again.  He perched up in a tree and ate whatever he picked up in the lake.  Thinking back on it I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but think about the double rainbow guy on YouTube.  I had thoughts of me saying, &amp;ldquo;An eagle!  What does it mean?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

After Jenny and I each had a run we ran into town to get some chai tea and a smoothie.  We then ventured into Eagle River to hit the liquor store.  All that took a surprisingly long time.  By the time we got back it was lunch time!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was my morning to get up with Quin.  He didn&amp;rsquo;t go to bed until 10:00 last night, so it was a bit of a surprise when he got up at 6:00 like normal.  Luckily I just convinced him to lay down and within about 10 seconds he fell back to sleep until 8:00.  By that time his diaper was a wreck!  I was changing the mess that had accumulated saying something about &amp;ldquo;stinky poop&amp;rdquo; or something, and Quin said &amp;ldquo;I poop potty.&amp;rdquo;  I asked him, &amp;ldquo;really?&amp;rdquo;  Quoting a perfect Donkey from Shrek he said, &amp;ldquo;Really, really.&amp;rdquo;  Chalk another one up to nurture.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;All good things must come to an end.  We pretty much just got up and left first thing on Sunday morning.  It was looking like a very hot day, and the time we did spend outside packing the cars found us swatting at a lot of mosquitoes which had been very sparse the rest of the week.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lots of interesting things happened during the week, but here is a quick summary of some of the more memorable things:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The trip started out somewhat inauspiciously.  I had neglected to pack anything - Jenny packed all the kids&amp;rsquo; stuff as well as mine, but there was still a pile of things that I needed to take care of the morning of our departure.  My parents, Blaine, and Brett along with respective lady friends of each of theirs joined us the day prior to celebrate mom and dad&amp;rsquo;s 39th wedding anniversary by going to IrishFest in Milwaukee.  It was a good time, but afforded us a little less &amp;ldquo;last minute&amp;rdquo; packing time than normal.  I thought we would be fine as long as we just packed in the morning&amp;hellip;  It seemed Karma didn&amp;rsquo;t want us to leave, for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Day 2 was a lazy day.  The weather was beautiful and sunny, so we did a lot of swimming and hanging out at the campsite.  Along with your usual swimming, running, eating drinking, and sunshine activities, the following things stuck out:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Quin introduced the world to his &amp;ldquo;booty-butt.&amp;rdquo;  Somewhere along the line he picked up the term &amp;ldquo;booty&amp;rdquo; as a word for his bottom, but he never really dropped the &amp;ldquo;butt&amp;rdquo; part.  Now he just says them both.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Quin and I did a bit of kayaking.  At one point I started singing &amp;ldquo;Row your boat,&amp;rdquo; and Quin finished the song for me.  He is a wonderful singer!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jenny&amp;rsquo;s parents stayed with us last night, so Ethan went to sleep at Jacob&amp;rsquo;s cabin with the Abholds.  That didn&amp;rsquo;t last too long, unfortunately.  At about 1:30 we heard somebody talking to us through our window - it was Micky telling us that Jacob had gotten sick and that Ethan was now feeling sick, so she was returning him to us for the night.  So much for that idea&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By morning, Ethan was feeling fine.  It was rainy and a little cold today, so we went up to the U.P. to check out a waterfall up there.  It was pretty awesome.  Bond Falls, it was called (I think).  One really neat thing about it was all the trails around the falls.  They had some permanent, wood trails built that gave you very good access to the entirety of the bottom of the falls.  They then had some &amp;ldquo;off road&amp;rdquo; trails you could take up the side of the falls on one side, and a paved set of stairs on the other side.  Ethan found his way up the non-paved side and made us all follow him, but it was worth it.  What views!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The other day we were at a party where we stayed pretty late.  On the way home, Ethan engaged us in interesting conversation, as always.  I can&amp;rsquo;t remember the exact context, but he asked something about somebody and if they were &amp;ldquo;a black.&amp;rdquo;  We told him that it was not appropriate to refer to somebody as &amp;ldquo;a black,&amp;rdquo; it could be insulting.  Instead he should use &amp;ldquo;black person,&amp;rdquo; or better yet, &amp;ldquo;African American.&amp;rdquo;  He took this in stride and continued on with his conversation.  After we got home, I was upstairs putting him to bed, when he asked me, &amp;ldquo;Dad, is it OK to call myself &amp;lsquo;a white?&amp;rsquo;  If I do that, am I insulting myself?&amp;rdquo;  I had to tell him that I honestly didn&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Baby Driver</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;They call him baby driver.&amp;rdquo;  My dad used to sing that song to us when we were young.  I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I ever heard the real version, but I remember it almost as well as him saying &amp;ldquo;wake up and piss, the world&amp;rsquo;s on fire.&amp;rdquo;  Anyway, I digress&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a busy spring here at the Grady house.  So busy, in fact, that we really haven&amp;rsquo;t had time to do any yard work besides the required lawn cutting so far.  This past weekend, that was about to change.  The weather was nice, we were going to be home for a whole day after ditching on our original plans to be in Neillsville for the whole weekend, (we opted for an up and back on a single day trip instead), so the stage was set.  Jenny went out and bought some annual flowers to plant in the various places throughout the yard.  Ethan&amp;rsquo;s and my job was to obtain some mulch and fill in our weedy, mulch-bare flower beds.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lots of new words, and the Amish</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quin&amp;rsquo;s been quite the learner the last few months.  I think since our vacation in April he&amp;rsquo;s been picking up an average of a couple new words a day.  He has his favorites, though.  My latest favorites are &amp;ldquo;nan&amp;rdquo; which means &amp;ldquo;dance,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;nonut,&amp;rdquo; which means &amp;ldquo;donut.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quin has a definite love of dancing.  He has figured out how to turn on various CD players and radios throughout the house, and once they are on, he will come and grab one of us to come and &amp;ldquo;nan.&amp;rdquo;  Today he figured out how to turn on Jenny&amp;rsquo;s iPod and was &amp;ldquo;nan&amp;quot;ing to that.  Not surprisingly, he&amp;rsquo;s the best dancer in the house.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We drove&amp;hellip;  A lot&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We left mom and dad&amp;rsquo;s place by 7:15.  After a Starbucks run to keep the monster in the passenger&amp;rsquo;s seat happy, and a stop at the gas station for some gas and an energy drink (to keep the van and the monster in the driver&amp;rsquo;s seat happy), we got out of town by 7:45.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not much to talk about here - we lunched at a Dairy Queen in Gallup New Mexico after passing through our first timezone.  There were many, many Native Americans there - the only non Native Americans were us and some old bitty behind the counter who took all her orders on a waitress pad then punched them into the register&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We started the day off again with a run through the Usery Recreational Area.  This time we knew where we were going, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t make it any less exciting.  We saw three hares (I believe that&amp;rsquo;s what they were) and a roadrunner.  Jenny was attacked by a cactus which waylaid us for a few minutes, but overall it was a nice run.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After spending several days with Quin, he seems to be getting smarter all the time!  No doubt it&amp;rsquo;s because of the extra exposure to me!!!  Anyway, I thought it would be a nice aside to go through some of Quin&amp;rsquo;s latest quotes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was nice to be somewhere that we didn&amp;rsquo;t have to be running all the time!  To celebrate, Jenny and I went for a run!!!  I had made it out in Denver for a quick 3 miler, but Jenny wanted to get out, so we went to the map and found somewhere that &amp;ldquo;looked like it had trails.&amp;rdquo;  After driving for about 10 minutes, we found a trailhead at the Usery Recreation Area and parked.  We didn&amp;rsquo;t have the $2 entrance fee for the self service registration, so we took all my dad&amp;rsquo;s change (we took his car), $1.45, put it in the envelope, and hoped for the best.  It was a nice run, but a word to the wise when running in the desert - if a trail has the word &amp;ldquo;wash&amp;rdquo; in it, don&amp;rsquo;t run on it!  We ran almost a mile on a trail called the Amigo Wash, which turns out to be a dried creek bed.  It was like running on a beach!!!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It sometimes frightens me to think what Ethan tells people about us. He and I are sitting in the car waiting for Jenny and mom to come out of a store and he&amp;rsquo;s telling me about how he and a girl from school have made up new words to a song that I had made up when I was a kid. Or was a parody to the tune of &amp;ldquo;this is it&amp;rdquo; by Huey Louis and the News called &amp;ldquo;Smell my Pits.&amp;rdquo;. I probably shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be telling him some of the things I tell him…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m writing this three days later, so there is a serious possibility that these memories will be stale&amp;hellip;  Oh well, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll get some comments from my wife and parents to help fill in the blanks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quinny got up &lt;em&gt;early&lt;/em&gt; this morning!  5:00 AM.  A 5PM afternoon nap of 90 minutes didn&amp;rsquo;t help us out here at all.  We tried to push him over to Grandpa and Grandma&amp;rsquo;s room right away, but he didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have much to do with that.  At one point Jenny and I were so mad at him that I took him out to the van to let him cry it out.  Eventually Jenny was able to take him over to breakfast and let Ethan and I sleep for a little while longer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Busy day, this one.  We woke up after &amp;ldquo;sleeping in&amp;rdquo; until 6:00 at the Hampton Inn in Flagstaff, AZ.  Very nice hotel, reasonably priced, with a nice rooms, decent continental breakfast, and most importantly, a POOL!!!  After Quin woke up, he and I went downstairs for some fruit, cereal, and juice.  Jenny and Ethan joined us shortly afterwards.  After we were sufficiently fed, we got into our swimming suits and took in some much deserved swimming.  We had the place to ourselves, which was nice since the kids are extremely loud!  I&amp;rsquo;d say we swam for at least an hour this way.  Ethan has become a very good swimmer and really enjoys the water.  He particularly likes when I launch him into flips, but we can only do that when nobody else is in the water.  Quin thinks that he can do anything that Ethan can do, but still can&amp;rsquo;t swim.  He really enjoys jumping from the edge of the pool into the water - not really jumping to me, but into the water.  I still catch him, though&amp;hellip;  He hates that!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Vacation 2010 - April 4, Driving...</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;OK, I&amp;rsquo;m a little out of order.  Bear with me.  April 4, Easter Sunday, was a day of driving.  I was actually able to get out of bed and get out for a 3.4 mile run in the crisp Denver morning (41 degrees but sunny).  Running in Denver is nice and not so nice.  Nice because they have so many running trails and there are so many cute girls that are generally out exercising as well (even when it is cold).  Not so nice because it is the &amp;ldquo;Mile High City&amp;rdquo; and that seems to play tricks on either my mind or my lungs or both.  The first 10 minutes of this run was brutal!  After that, though, I settled into a nice, slow trod and was able to complete the run.  A couple of &amp;ldquo;interesting&amp;rdquo; things I saw on the run - there were a bunch of old men out walking their equally old looking toy dogs, there was a guy that lived in the city that had outfitted his little postage sized lot of land into looking like a farm, complete with 3 classic tractors that he appeared to enjoy working on, and there was this one spot on the trail where somebody had spread out a bunch of bird seed, no doubt meant for birds, but was being hoarded by a group of wayward squirrels that were afraid of nothing!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Holy crap it&amp;rsquo;s windy!!!  Short post for now. Jenny and Ethan are out looking at the little Colorado river gorge about 15 miles east of the south rim park of the grand canyon. It&amp;rsquo;s not too cold out but I bet the wind is gusting up to 50 mph. It&amp;rsquo;s so bad that it tipped over 2 portapotties.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quinny is napping. We left him in the car to start with but then felt guilty so now I&amp;rsquo;m hanging out with him. We are heading over to the main park in a couple of minutes and will post a full recount along with pictures later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;OK, back to the standard keyboard.  Too much to write to try to do it on my little iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The day started out pretty early this morning.  Quin woke up around 5:00 local time, but that was OK with me since I had fallen asleep last night at 8:30 local.  Of course, in a single bedroom apartment, once anybody is up, everybody is pretty much up.  By 6:30, everybody was done pretending to be asleep anymore and we got up and ready for the day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve recently identified that I require an ipad in order to survive. In order to prepare myself I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to post my vacation blog entirely from my iPhone. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how long this lasts. I think I may be too old to learn to thumb type and ignore basic punctuation and spelling rules, but I suppose time will tell.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On this eve of &amp;ldquo;the closest thing the Irish have to Christmas,&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m sitting on my couch musing about my hopelessly silly kids.  Nature dictates that the oldest is silly like his dad, but nurture appears to have a strong influence on the youngest.  Too bad - we thought he had a chance!!!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We were out and about gathering materials for our latest home improvement project, built-in cabinets and a desk in our office (the wood floor was finished up two weeks ago).  After we finished getting some things at WalMart we came across some girl scouts selling cookies.  I have a soft spot for kids selling things, especially sweets, so I bought a box of Thanks-A-Lots (I think that makes 10 boxes this year).  Quin has a highly developed sweet tooth and immediately started saying one of his favorite words, &amp;ldquo;Cookie.&amp;rdquo;  We we opened up the box and all had one.  Not more than a minute later, Quin was again repeating &amp;ldquo;Cookie, cookie, cookie!&amp;rdquo;  Jenny thought he was palming it, or had just put it in his lap since very little time had passed and said to him, &amp;ldquo;no, you just had one.  Where is your cookie?&amp;rdquo;  Without missing a beat he leaned forward and opened his mouth and pointed to it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was traveling to Atlanta this past week, so Jenny and the boys were by themselves for three days!  It sounded like things were going pretty well, for the most part, until I was in the Hartfield Jackson Airport in Atlanta awaiting my boarding call to return home to Milwaukee.  That was when I received a call from Ethan.  &amp;ldquo;Dad,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;what do you do when Quin poops in the bathtub?&amp;rdquo;  You see, I am the poop cleaner in our house.  If it manages to get into a diaper or into the toilet, Jenny has no issue dealing with it.  If, on the other hand, it ends up somewhere outside the &amp;ldquo;norm,&amp;rdquo; that&amp;rsquo;s when dad the poopman steps in.  Unfortunately, the poopman was 700 miles away and wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be back in time to take care of this situation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quin is starting to talk quite a bit.  I&amp;rsquo;m happy to say that he is finally speaking in sentences!  Of course, most, if not all of his sentences are just telling us no to different things that we want him to do.  &amp;ldquo;No ni-ni.&amp;rdquo;  &amp;ldquo;No eat.&amp;rdquo;  &amp;ldquo;No Bath!&amp;rdquo;  I guess you have to start somewhere!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other day, Ethan, Quin, and I were out to eat and had some time to burn before we went to swimming lessons, so we went to Best Buy.  We walked in past the DVDs.  I was looking at the Weeds Season 5 DVD with Marie Louise Parker on the front - Quin pointed at the cover and said, &amp;ldquo;Mommy!&amp;rdquo;  I thought that was pretty nice, because even though she&amp;rsquo;s older than Jenny, she&amp;rsquo;s quite good looking.  We then progressed further down the aisle when Quin picked out another movie where he pointed at Brad Pitt and said, &amp;ldquo;Daddy.&amp;rdquo;  Smart boy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year!  In the name of New Year&amp;rsquo;s Resolutions, I&amp;rsquo;ve resolved to blog on a more regular basis this year!  I&amp;rsquo;ve found that blogging is nice on several levels.  It allows people who care to follow along with what is going on with our lives (or ignore it, which is nice as well).  This is important right now since my parents have moved to Arizona for the remainder of this winter and will be grandchild starved for 3 months!  But more than that, it allows us to go back years later and see what we were doing now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Of course my wife reminded me of some things I forgot&amp;hellip;  If only she knew how to blog!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other day Ethan and I were driving to Soccer when we passed a section of road we frequently pass.  On one side of the road is a pretty steep, tree-covered hill with a couple of houses on top.  Ethan asked me, matter of factly, if the people living there were hillbillies.  To be honest, I was laughing to myself, but calmly collected myself before explaining that they were not hillbillies.  I was a little surprised that I was unable to come up with a really good description of a hillbilly without referencing Deliverance&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quin climbed out of his crib the other day.  We were working around the house and he was acting like he was tired.  He generally doesn&amp;rsquo;t like to take naps during the day, but we like him to take naps.  So I put him in his crib and began to let him &amp;ldquo;cry it out.&amp;rdquo;  I went outside to take care of something, and a couple of minutes later came back inside to find Quin standing downstairs, smiling at me.  He hasn&amp;rsquo;t done it since, but we now know it is possible&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here it is, the big vacation update!  Of course, it&amp;rsquo;s been a month since we went, so the memories have already started to fade, but I&amp;rsquo;ve uploaded some pictures to our photo gallery and the site&amp;rsquo;s slideshow is now showing them.  Hopefully this gives a better idea of how the vacation went.  To see all of the pictures in the album, either click on the slideshow, or try &lt;a href=&#34;http://picasaweb.google.com/grady.mke/EagleRiver2009#&#34;&gt;this link here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist blogging this before my &amp;ldquo;big vacation update&amp;rdquo; later this week&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quin has been talking A LOT MORE lately.  I sat down to try to figure out the words he knew now and lost track.  He&amp;rsquo;s become much more interesting in the last month or so.  Anyway, a game that I always play with him is to push his nose and say &amp;ldquo;beep beep.&amp;rdquo;  Ethan might do it to him, too.  So now he goes around and pushes people&amp;rsquo;s noses and says &amp;ldquo;bee bee&amp;rdquo; just like we do&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This is a picture of Quinton kissing his cousin.  Man, he&amp;rsquo;s really going for it!  OK, they are second cousins once removed, or third cousins or something (you&amp;rsquo;d have to ask Blaine for the exact designation), so that&amp;rsquo;s probably OK in most You can tell they are from awhile ago as they were for Jodi&amp;rsquo;s baby shower - and they&amp;rsquo;ve already had the baby!!!  Man, I just don&amp;rsquo;t &amp;lsquo;blog enough&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This year we went on the 3 day camp.  Camp started at 9:00 AM and went until 4:00 PM.  Besides the mosquitoes, it was a bona-fide blast for both of us.  Ethan was able to do all sorts of different activities, including archery (which is is very good at), mini-golf (which he is not so good at), highlander games, knight&amp;rsquo;s quest, etc.  For me, it was a good opportunity for me to see Ethan interact with other kids and adults and how he did in the different physical and social situations.  Let me tell you, if you ever find yourself annoyed at your child, spend some time with other people&amp;rsquo;s children - like 18 of them.  You will quickly appreciate your own!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Two weeks ago she suffered what appears to be a slipped disc in her back.  Her back legs quickly became disabled, and over the course of the next two weeks she lost control of her bladder and bowels.  She was almost nine years old.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The kids really loved her.  Quin probably moreso than Ethan, though she&amp;rsquo;s been a fixture in our house since Ethan has been around.  Quinton just loved her, despite the fact that he tried to kick her on occasion and pulled her hair, all of which she handled without complaint.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Ethan and Quin&amp;rsquo;s only remaining great-grandmother passed away, Ethan received his first communion, and Quin has had his first ride on the lawnmower&amp;hellip;  Let&amp;rsquo;s begin.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To set the table, I used to watch video blogs on the mac while I was feeding Quin last year.  It was nice because I was able to control them with the remote control while I used my other hand to hold the bottle.  One of my favorite blogs is College Humor.  The video I happened to be watching that day was titled &amp;ldquo;Pot Cookie Monster&amp;rdquo; about a cookie monster like the one from Sesame Street but instead of regular cookies, he liked pot cookies&amp;hellip;  Here is the video&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been awhile since I&amp;rsquo;ve updated this site on my favorite 7-year old.  Ethan&amp;rsquo;s been doing quite a bit lately, now in the home stretch of his 2nd grade year, about to receive his first communion.  But why the title &amp;ldquo;3 S&amp;rsquo;s for Ethan?&amp;rdquo;  Really it all stems from a sad little game I play with my brain when I&amp;rsquo;m trying to remember something.  I figure my brain can only remember 3 things at a time, and then only if I name them interestingly.  In this case, I came up with three things I wanted to write about for Ethan, and I managed to make them all conform to some word starting with S.  Let&amp;rsquo;s begin:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Smartest Kid Alive???</title>

My first clue happened a couple of days ago.  We sat him in his high-chair to feed him and mixed all of the food onto his tray.  His tray does have segmented areas, but we generally just put stuff in the large middle one.  I think we put some chicken, apples, cheese, and crackers on the tray.  He finished up the apples and cheese pretty quickly as they are two of his favorite foods, but the crackers and chicken remained in the center.  I turned around to do something (I would claim that I was doing dishes, but my wife may call my lie out on that one), and when I turned back, all but a few of the crackers had been placed in one of the segmented partitions.  I watched in amazement as he sorted the remaining 2 or 3 crackers out from the chicken and the proceeded to eat the crackers one by one, all the while ignoring the chicken (he doesn&amp;rsquo;t like meat very much).  Some could argue that it is an early sign of OCD, but I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure it&amp;rsquo;s an early sign of pure genius!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quin and Ethan have been busy folks as of late.  Quin went and turned one and we barely even acknowledged it!  Well, digitally anyway.  In true Grady boy fashion, Quin celebrated his birthday not once, not twice, but three separate times so that he could cover all his bases.  Our favorite celebration was the one we had at our house with just our little family, though.  It was the first time Quin really got to dig into some chocolate cake, and boy do I think he was impressed!!!  Here you see him starting his sugar coma!  It didn&amp;rsquo;t take him long and he was pretty much demanding that he be fed cake any time one of us was eating some.  I had a piece on my plate the other day when he was eating his supper and he spit out the noodles he had in his mouth and screamed until I gave him a bit of my cake!  He may have a sweet tooth&amp;hellip;  Now to figure out how to take advantage of it&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As of last night, Quinton has become one of the walkers of the world. He took his first tenuous steps from Jenny to myself last night before bed. Everybody was very excited. Well, Ethan was a little disappointed since he was in the shower when it happened, but was excited nonetheless. Looks like it&amp;rsquo;s time to get the house to the next level of baby-proofness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another score for the &amp;ldquo;nurture&amp;rdquo; portion of the nature vs. nurture debate. Quinton walked when he was 11 months, 2 days old. Ethan first walked when he was 11 months, 0 days old. These results are not scientific by any means.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I have mailed a &amp;ldquo;2008 Year in Review&amp;rdquo; to some of you, those that I knew could take it (it&amp;rsquo;s a 30 minute video of our family).  If you would like one of your own and did not receive one, please e-mail me and I will be happy to send one out to you.  Now, on to the updates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;ethan&#34;&gt;Ethan&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We had Ethan&amp;rsquo;s parent-teacher conference yesterday.  He is doing very well in School, mostly thanks to Jenny.  She works with him constantly on his school work as well as reading, basic math and the like.  It&amp;rsquo;s a lot of work, but it is apparently paying off.  While in the conference we were able to read some of Ethan&amp;rsquo;s stories and reports that he&amp;rsquo;s been writing up.  I plan on posting a couple of them to this blog in the near future.  One of them which is hilarious is his essay on what he would do if he were president.  He is clearly a democrat in the making, let&amp;rsquo;s just put it that way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quin has learned the fine art of movement.  He still doesn&amp;rsquo;t really &amp;ldquo;crawl,&amp;rdquo; necessarily, but he lilts along like an army man.  Actually he looks a little like Igor would look if he crawled.  Since he&amp;rsquo;s been in motion, he&amp;rsquo;s bee quite happy and quite a handful.  I don&amp;rsquo;t remember if Ethan got into as much when he was younger, but Quin really likes to get into everything!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Quin&amp;rsquo;s also been sick for the last week or so.  He hasn&amp;rsquo;t really let it get him down, but his stomach has obviously not been feeling well for quite awhile.  That part is easy to remember from when Ethan was younger, unfortunately.  He hangs in there, though.  On the worst day, we had to change his clothes 4 times!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Poor kid&amp;hellip;  On October 2, 2008, we had our final court date at the Waukesha County Juvenile Court to finalize, legally, our adoption.  Largely it was uneventful, but it still managed to choke me up a little bit.  While there we met another family that was finalizing, except this was their THIRD adoption!  Crazy folks!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quin&amp;rsquo;s getting bigger and moving around more and more all the time.  Today, I&amp;rsquo;m proud to say, he said his first word that I could understand.  Jenny was telling me that daycare said that Quin had been saying &amp;ldquo;dada&amp;rdquo; lately.  When he heard her say that, he promptly said &amp;ldquo;dada&amp;rdquo; to us.  We&amp;rsquo;re working on &amp;ldquo;mama,&amp;rdquo; but hey, the kid knows what he likes!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I know that I&amp;rsquo;m getting  behind because my wife has told me that I&amp;rsquo;m in trouble because of how infrequently I blog.  I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know she knew I had a blog&amp;hellip;  Oh well&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quin&amp;rsquo;s doing great!  He&amp;rsquo;s 7 months old now and is quite mobile.  No, he still doesn&amp;rsquo;t (really) crawl, but has developed a rolling technique that enables him to get pretty much wherever he wants to go.  He&amp;rsquo;s also started to try out the &amp;ldquo;all fours&amp;rdquo; thing by getting up on his knees and lunching towards things that are slightly out of his reach.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

That&amp;rsquo;s right, Quin&amp;rsquo;s first tooth has finally busted its way through his gums.  We were wondering why he&amp;rsquo;s been so crabby lately, and the old &amp;ldquo;well, he&amp;rsquo;s probably teething&amp;rdquo; excuse was wearing a little thin some 4 months later.  But lo and behold, it really was true this time!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here you can see him having a deep conversation with an old Elmo doll.  He seems a little skeptical I think&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He &amp;ldquo;fared&amp;rdquo; pretty well, though I&amp;rsquo;m not sure it was entirely his cup of tea just yet.  Ethan had a blast, at least for the most part.  We started out by getting a wrist band and going on the rides.  This is really the first year where Ethan was ready to go on the &amp;ldquo;big kids&amp;rdquo; rides.  Unfortunately we were there with Micky and her kids, and they aren&amp;rsquo;t quite ready.  Not to worry, we split up for an hour and allowed Ethan to go on several rides by himself, and he had a blast.  He even got to go on the bumper cars while I talked with a couple of Chicago guys waiting for their kids.  The only things he was not able to go on were the rides that had a 52 inch height limit.  Apparently he isn&amp;rsquo;t quite 50 inches yet.  Guess the NBA isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily in his future!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Time is flying by.  Quin is starting to get more and more independent, which is nice as he was being a bit clingy for awhile there.  He is very good at rolling and can sometimes even roll from his back to his stomach.  His latest trick is to stay in a seated position if we put him in one to start with.  He&amp;rsquo;s also reaching for toys and other things that are out of reach, which I&amp;rsquo;m told is a developmental milestone.  So way to go, Quin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I ran in this event last year along with a team that we had assembled known as &amp;ldquo;Big Sky Multisport.&amp;rdquo;  We had our own jerseys and a whole bunch of people.  Ethan was so impressed when he came to watch!  He wanted to be &amp;ldquo;on my team.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This year we did it again, and they have a kid&amp;rsquo;s event.  So I ordered Ethan a jersey and he competed in the kid&amp;rsquo;s triathlon.  Well, it was actually a duathlon this year since we&amp;rsquo;ve had so much rain this summer that the lake where we swim is closed with algae problems&amp;hellip;  At any rate, Ethan is now offiially a Big Sky Multisport member.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In the past two weeks, Quin has been passing milestones by the handful and I have neglected to document them here, so here goes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago Friday, Quin passed not one, not two, but three milestones in a 12 hour period.  First, he ate rice cereal for the first time, and gobbled it up completely.  I mean, he really liked it!  Next, after his meal, Brett and I put him on the floor and he was observed for the first time rolling over (he had previously rolled over in bed two times, but this was the first time another human saw him).  To top off the act, Quin slept for 9.5 hours that night from 8:30 to 6:00!!!  That was the big one in my book!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m just sitting here doing some scout stuff and Quin is sitting right next to me in one of his bouncy chairs.  What&amp;rsquo;s different than normal is that he is grabbing &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; within reach.  He has access to a bunch of toys within reach and he is studying each one of them intently.  This is a first for him and quite exciting for us.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It all started out innocently enough.  We were going to church on Sunday morning, after which Ethan was supposed to attend a birthday party for a girl in his class.  While in the &amp;ldquo;gathering place&amp;rdquo; after mass, Ethan was horsing around with a buddy of his when his head got bumped and one of his loose teeth started bleeding.  On came the waterworks!  He insisted that he was in no shape to go to the party.  We drove to where we were going to meet to discuss with hosts, one of who was a dentist no less, all the while Ethan was crying in the back seat.  Luckily for us, the party was postponed due to inclement weather.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;birthday-boy&#34;&gt;Birthday Boy&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;May 17th was Ethan&amp;rsquo;s 7th birthday.  To celebrate, we invited the boys from his class to join us at the YMCA for some cake, games, and swimming.  Unfortunately, Ethan has only 5 boys in his class, including himself.  Even more unfortunate, one of the boys didn&amp;rsquo;t show up, so there were only 4 boys there.  Actually, that ended up being lucky for us as boys are crazy!  The spent the bulk of their time wrestling and smashing into one another.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We&amp;rsquo;ve had a good couple of weeks with him so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share with the lot of you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First off, he&amp;rsquo;s now eating about 5 ounces at a time every 4 hours.  Unfortunately, he&amp;rsquo;s still doing that at night as well.  Although, some nights he&amp;rsquo;s been known to go 6 or more hours between feedings, and when he does wake up to eat, he&amp;rsquo;s very good about going back to sleep promptly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-trip-home&#34;&gt;The Trip Home&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At 6:30 we got up &amp;ldquo;officially.&amp;rdquo;  Jenny had packed the night before so we could maximize our sleep, but Quin had different ideas.  By 7:30 we were showered and ready to go.  A bellman picked us up at our room and took us to the &amp;ldquo;Common House&amp;rdquo; for checkout.  Here we were actually able to check our bags onto the airplane and get our boarding passes.  This Magical Express thing was really nice!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;morning-swim&#34;&gt;Morning Swim&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, our last day at the parks.  It&amp;rsquo;s been a pretty eventful week.  A bit tiring, but definitely memorable.  Today we had reservations at EPCOT early, 4:45, so we planned on spending the day there again.  There was a lot at this park that we haven&amp;rsquo;t yet done.  Also, mom and dad really like the world showcase, so there seemed plenty to do for the entire family.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We woke up late again today.  It was a bit of a rough night with Quin.  He had been very good all week up until, and for the most part including tonight.  This time, though, he was up a little bit in the night, not awake, but fussing.  It made it a bit difficult to get really good sleep.  Ethan didn&amp;rsquo;t have any troubles, though, which was all that really mattered.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;late-start&#34;&gt;Late Start&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quin was up during the night and we were getting tired, so we slept in a little bit this morning.  Jenny and I got out for a run around the 1.4 mile running path that goes around the resort (we went twice around), we gave the kids baths, then we grabbed a leisurely breakfast at the Shutters food court at our resort.  It was a good jumping off point for the rest of the day, which we planned on spending at Animal Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Rather than sleeping in and dealing with the crowds of people, we thought we&amp;rsquo;d leave a little early in hopes of getting on some more rides in less confined areas.  So we took off early for the bus (OK, I think we still got on the bus around 9:00) and headed for the Magic Kingdom.  If you&amp;rsquo;ve never been to Disney, the Magic Kingdom is one of those parks that you can spend days and days in, so our two half days really didn&amp;rsquo;t do it justice, but it would have to do.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

My biggest worry coming to this resort with an infant was that he would be up and unconsolable in the night and he would wake people up.  Turns out I had nothing to worry about all along.  In fact, I would say that Quin probably slept better at the hotel than he does at home.  That is most likely because we were so close by and it was easy to get up to tend to him.  Either way, it worked out well and I had nothing to complain about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

On Monday, both birth parents were given one last opportunity to choose to parent Quin.  The birth mother showed up and gave up her right to do so, and the birth father did not answer the attempts to contact him.  That&amp;rsquo;s an important step for us!  That means that there shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be any bad Lifetime movies written about our situation any time soon.  Now, we&amp;rsquo;re still not the official parents of Quin, still only the foster parents.  The adoption agency is now the legal guardian of Quin and all major medical decisions and travel plans must now be arranged through them.  We will also have three home visits from the agency to make sure things are going well.  After Quin has been with us for 6 months, the agency will file for a court date in Waukesha to make the adoption official.  At that time we will get a birth certificate and have the ability to apply for a social security number.  As you can guess, we&amp;rsquo;re very happy about this step.  It is a major one!  We feel very fortunate given all that could have happened.  Jenny was in contact with an adoptive family who had been selected only to have the birth parents change their minds just before the child was born.  I&amp;rsquo;ve also heard stories recently about people who were going through the legal risk period only to have the birth grandmother decide she was going to care for the child three days prior to the termination of parental rights hearing.  She went through the trouble of having her daughter declared unfit to parent so she became the legal guardian.  Needless to say, we feel very fortunate and blessed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Almost like his golden birthday in days!  Jenny had to go in to work today, so Quin and I worked from home, and let me tell you, he does better work than some of the interns I&amp;rsquo;ve had!  I fed him once at 7:00, then he didn&amp;rsquo;t want to eat again until around noon (my mistake as I got lost in e-mails for awhile).  After that, he slept again until Jenny got him around 3:00, so like I said, he probably did more good (or less bad) than some of the interns I&amp;rsquo;ve had.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ethan and I had a wonderful boy&amp;rsquo;s day today.  Jenny took Quin up to meet his aunts in the Dells while celebrating their mom&amp;rsquo;s birthday.  Since it was a rare beautiful day, Ethan and I decided to go skiing at our local &amp;ldquo;mountain.&amp;rdquo;  Really it&amp;rsquo;s a recovered garbage dump, I think&amp;hellip;  It&amp;rsquo;s definitely not a mountain, but it&amp;rsquo;s close.  The last time Ethan skied was last year in the U.P. and he did really well.  Today was no different.  He hasn&amp;rsquo;t forgotten much from his time in ski school.  The early going was a little rough.  He had some control problems and was a little timid of the rope tow.  But after two times down the hill, he was going up the rope himself and starting to be a bit of a daredevil.  He was doing a little more &amp;ldquo;french fries&amp;rdquo; and less &amp;ldquo;pizza&amp;rdquo; than I&amp;rsquo;m comfortable with.  We were there for two hours, each time Ethan would say, &amp;ldquo;one more time down,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;five more times down.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It was going to be later in the day, so we took Ethan out of school around 12:30 and headed over to the hospital. When we walked into the nursery, we were surprised to find two doctors circumcising Quin. We thought that had happened already in the morning!  Well, it was somewhat interesting to watch, but Ethan was not so impressed.  He asked me what was going on.  After telling him, he was officially appalled and decided he didn&amp;rsquo;t want to watch or be near that, so we went and found a TV for him to watch Zathura.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

OK, that will be his name assuming the whole adoption goes through, but since the birth mother has not named him, we will refer to him from here on out as &amp;ldquo;Quin.&amp;rdquo; Quin was born via a Caesarian section delivery in a Madison area hospital. He weighed 6 pounds 11 ounces and was 19 3/4 inches long. He has a pretty good head of straight black hair and brown eyes (so far as we can tell).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m putting a stake in the ground to start doing these again.  Perhaps once a week is a good goal, but I need to get it done&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So much has happened since the last time I &amp;lsquo;blogged, it would be foolish to try to recap.  Instead, I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about the most significant event of recent memory, our adoption.  Jenny and I have been trying to have another child for several years now, but with no success.  Finally last year we visited a fertility doctor who informed us it was unlikely to happen for various reasons.  Rather than try to get a donor egg and try invetro fertilization, we decided to pursue adoption.  Three weeks ago, we were finally selected by a birth mother.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>First Tooth...</title>
      <link>http://dogsbuttbrew.com/reclaimed/first-tooth.../</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been fun the last few weeks.  Ethan still is getting green slips at school, but he still tells us about it each time.  He also is learning his letters very well and is very good with numbers.  Jenny and I are both very proud of his schoolwork.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tonight was the annual Harvest Dance at school.  The gym had a bouncy castle and a bunch of games.  We spent nearly 2 hours there.  Ethan decided he wanted to go as a Power Ranger just in case one of his friends was there who was also a Power Ranger.  The best thing that happened, though, was Ethan lost his first tooth right there in the gym.  This tooth has been loose for weeks already.  A few weeks ago, Jenny and I discovered a new tooth growing in behind his baby teeth.  We, being inexperienced first time parents, took him to the dentist who told us to just let nature take its course.  I&amp;rsquo;ve been continually hounding him to keep wiggling it, hoping that the sure bet of braces could be avoided at least with this first lost tooth.  He has been afraid of having anybody touch it except for him, and he hasn&amp;rsquo;t been that good at wiggling it either.  Last night I even tried playing a modified college drinking game with him saying that each time the word &amp;ldquo;bear&amp;rdquo; was used in the movie &amp;ldquo;Brother Bear,&amp;rdquo; he should wiggle his tooth.  Tonight, his worries and ours were finally put to rest.  After putting a jaw breaker in his mouth, Ethan found that the tooth had finally worked its way out of its position.  There was blood all over in his mouth.  He opened up, and I did the final severing of the last pieces of tissue.  Jenny had a tissue that she gave to him.  Surprisingly, he didn&amp;rsquo;t mind having all that blood in his mouth at all.  In fact, I think he kind of enjoyed it.  It didn&amp;rsquo;t hurt or anything, he told me.  On the way out to the bathroom to clean up, he had to stop by the registration table to inform the ladies working there that he had just lost a tooth.  The rest of the evening he went up to each kid he knew and smiled at them, pointing at his newly vacant spot in his mouth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;OK, it&amp;rsquo;s been quite awhile again, but I thought the time was right to update some of Ethan&amp;rsquo;s stats on this site.  Really what forced me to do it was some of the things Ethan said to me tonight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First thing&amp;rsquo;s first, Ethan has an adult tooth coming in behind his existing baby teeth on the bottom of his mouth.  Jenny and I don&amp;rsquo;t really know anything about this, so we took him to the dentist.  He has a very loose tooth that is about to be replaced by this much larger one, but it is not out yet, and the new tooth appears to be hindered by another not loose tooth on the other side.  Luckily the dentist said everything looks OK.  He seemed to be a bit concerned that he was getting these teeth already since his mouth is not big enough to accommodate these new teeth, but at least we&amp;rsquo;re OK for now.  In the mean time, Ethan is very excited to have the tooth fairy just around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a lovely evening in the North Woods.  This week is our family vacation, and this year we have chosen to spend it in St. Germain, WI at a cabin on the lake.  It&amp;rsquo;s absolutely lovely up here!!!  We&amp;rsquo;re not more than 30 feet from the lake.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We weren&amp;rsquo;t here for 10 minutes before Ethan had his swimming suit on and was in the water!!!  It&amp;rsquo;s really amazing to me how he&amp;rsquo;s taken to the water in the last few months.  Anyway, he no longer has any problem with water over his head (as long as he&amp;rsquo;s wearing a life jacket).  The beach is literally 30 feet from our house, so he&amp;rsquo;s been in the water more than he&amp;rsquo;s been out of it for the last 30 hours.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He knows who Jack Black is and wants to see Nacho Libre, and in my book, that makes you cool.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we were outside talking about the new DVD he took out from the library.  He said that one part doesn&amp;rsquo;t play very well, and told me that the reason was &amp;ldquo;probably because mommy put a fingerprint on the shiny side.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-joke&#34;&gt;First joke&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ethan told me his first real joke the other day.  Here it is&amp;hellip;  &amp;ldquo;Why is the corn stalk mad?  -Because people are always pulling on their ears!&amp;rdquo;  Of course he followed this up with &amp;ldquo;Why is the bear mad?  -Because people are always pulling their hair!&amp;rdquo;  So maybe he doesn&amp;rsquo;t have that great of a sense of humor&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;clowns&#34;&gt;Clowns&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was Jenny&amp;rsquo;s birthday a last week.  Ethan and I were outside waiting for her to go roller blading.  While we were waiting, I started talking to Ethan about Jenny&amp;rsquo;s birthdy present.  Here&amp;rsquo;s how the conversation went down.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My baby is 5 years old!  This year&amp;rsquo;s birthday was particularly fun.  Not only was he really looking forward to his birthday, but he was looking forward to his parties as well.  So far Ethan&amp;rsquo;s had 2 parties.  The first was on his birthday, last Wednesday.  We had the Abholds, the Witte&amp;rsquo;s, and the Kelchen&amp;rsquo;s over for supper and cake.  Ethan loved all of his presents he got there.  Then, last weekend, we went up to Minneapolis to have a joint birthday party for Ethan and Bryce with the Grady&amp;rsquo;s.  Also very fun.  Jenny and I bought him a Rescue Hero Hyperjet, which is this huge carrier ship looking toy that Ethan loves.  He loves it so much that we had to put it in the van and cart it all over the midwest this weekend!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We took our annual trip to Wisconsin Dells last weekend.  We met the Hupperts, friends of ours from Seattle who now live in Baldwin, WI, at the Wilderness Resort for the evening.  Ted and Sue have two little boys, Teddy, who is 3.5, and Charlie, who is 1.5.  Ethan had a very good time with Teddy this time.  He gets along with kids younger than him very well.  Ethan is getting braver and braver as he gets older, but he is still a bit scared of certain things.  He had no problems going down all of the kids&amp;rsquo; slides, even the big ones.  I was even able to get him to go on a family tube ride one time.  It was pretty dark inside the ride, though.  After the ride he told me, &amp;ldquo;that wasn&amp;rsquo;t so scary.&amp;rdquo;  So I asked if he wanted to go again, to which he promptly replied &amp;ldquo;No!&amp;rdquo;  It was a fun weekend.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ice Age - The Meltdown</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s another in my series of reviews of Children&amp;rsquo;s movies.  This time, Ethan and I went to see Ice Age, The Meltdown.  Ice Age 2 is the second movie by Blue Sky Productions (I think) under the Fox production company.  Like the first Ice Age, it is a computer animated movie about three prehistoric animals who became a &amp;ldquo;herd&amp;rdquo; of their own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This time around, the world is warming up and all of the animals live in a large bowl formed by an 80 foot high ice dam.  They have to make it to the other end of the valley before the end of the week before the dam breaks and they all drown.  Along the way, Manny, the mammoth, starts to believe that his species is extinct.  That is, until he meets up with a mammoth (I forget her name) that thinks she is a possum.  Her and her two &amp;ldquo;brothers&amp;rdquo; add hijinx to the film by injecting pop phrases and making fun of the other three.  Anyway, the gist of the movie is about loss and getting past it.  It&amp;rsquo;s kind of a deep subject for kids, but I think it is enjoyable enough for them to stay interested even they don&amp;rsquo;t really &amp;ldquo;get it.&amp;rdquo;  You see, Manny lost his entire family (wife and child) to a group of hunters and he&amp;rsquo;s never really gotten past it.  Now, faced with extinction, he has to try to get past his feelings of loss and try to start over with this new mammoth (played by Queen Latifah), but first he has to convince her that she is not a possum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nothing very long today.  I just have some nuggets from the past couple of days that are worth sharing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we were driving back from KFC and Ethan could smell some of the food.  He mentioned something about how good the food smelled and then said, &amp;ldquo;Mmm, the sweet smell of french fries!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, today we were outside changing the oil in the lawn mower, and Ethan turned to me and said, &amp;ldquo;Dad, if you eat fire, then you will fart fire, and your tongue will be on fire, too.&amp;rdquo;  I guess I never thought of it&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We had our second parent-teacher conference with Ethan&amp;rsquo;s teacher, Mrs. Matyas yesterday.  This conference went much better than the first conference.  Apparently Ethan is progressing very well and doing a wonderful job in school.  He still needs work on his fine motor skills, but he at least knows enough to raise his hand before he talks.  I guess he still loves to tell stories.  In fact, he tells everybody that he is going to have a baby sister.  Unfortunately, Jenny is not pregnant, so that is just not true&amp;hellip;  I guess he is the only kid in class that is an only child, and that makes him feel left out sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I just wanted to jot some random thoughts down about Ethan so that they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be lost.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The other day Ethan asked me, &amp;ldquo;Dad, is Jesus stronger than Superman?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Ethan has quite an affinity for his &amp;ldquo;booty.&amp;rdquo;  The other day, he pulled his pants down in the back, exposing his plumber crack, and asked me, straight-faced, &amp;ldquo;has anybody seen my underwear?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;He is very interested in babies and how they are made.  He is especially interested in how they get out of their mommy&amp;rsquo;s stomachs.  I told him I didn&amp;rsquo;t know but that he should ask Micky, our friend who is pregnant.  He told me that maybe the come out of their ears.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Last night, Ethan told me that poop comes from your brain.  Not sure how he came up with that one.  Everybody knows that&amp;rsquo;s where boogers come from, not poop.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t remember the exact context, but the other day Ethan was saying some pretty funny stuff.  He was talking about liking something or not liking something (what, I can&amp;rsquo;t remember), and a couple of minutes into it he said, &amp;ldquo;I changed my mind, I like it.  &lt;strong&gt;I must be out of my mind.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today we took Ethan to the Curious George movie.  Jenny and I both liked it, although it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have as much to enjoy for adults as do some other recent &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; movies.  Will Ferrel is just a funny, funny guy.  I would laugh just watching him drink coffee.  He stars as the voice of Ted, George&amp;rsquo;s human friend.  Very cute movie.  I recommend it for any child over the age of 3 (and I think they were all there today).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ethan is so excited.  Today he gets to wear his pajamas to school.  When I told him, the first thing he asked me was, &amp;ldquo;is everybody going to wear them?&amp;rdquo;  After I told him yes, it was full steam ahead.  He picked out the pajamas he wanted, made us wash them, and picked out some slippers.  This morning he told me that he didn&amp;rsquo;t want any milk on his cereal so he didn&amp;rsquo;t get his jammies wet&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of Ethan&amp;rsquo;s favorite things to do is to watch movies.  He is probably one of the youngest movie &amp;ldquo;quoters&amp;rdquo; that I know.  In the last few days, Ethan and I have seen a couple of new movies that are notworthy in that they have left an impression on Ethan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first movie we saw was during the Bears-Panthers game on Sunday, Hoodwinked.  Hoodwinked is the story of Little Red Riding Hood told from perspective of those involved, Red, Grandma, the Big Bad Wolf, and the axe wielding Schnitzel truck driver.  All in all it was a very funny movie and an interesting take on the fairy tale.  One of Ethan&amp;rsquo;s favorite parts was when one of the characters said something strange then bowed off the screen slowly, all the while smiling, while another character said &amp;ldquo;awkward&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;  What&amp;rsquo;s funny to me is that I&amp;rsquo;m sure he has no idea what that scene, not to mention that word meant, but he thought it was so funny that he decided to quote it later to Jenny and I.  Anyway, I give Hoodwinked 3 stars and caution parents with children that have no sense of humor to stay away from it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wow, has my son turned into a little snot all of a sudden.  If this is what it&amp;rsquo;s like to have teen-agers, I want no part of it.  I know, I know, those are much worse!  I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what happened, but since I picked him up from school today he has been quite a little snot.  He started by informing me that I&amp;rsquo;m not the boss, and that he didn&amp;rsquo;t like me anymore.  I asked him why, and he told me that he didn&amp;rsquo;t like the things I said to him&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ethan had a second Christmas program this year, this time at his old school (daycare).  At the daycare Christmas program, you can only watch your child sing because there just isn&amp;rsquo;t room for everybody to be in the LMR (large muscle room) at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, after Ethan&amp;rsquo;s portion of the program was done, we joined him, his classmates, and their parents in his room, the 4 1/2 year old room for cookies and punch.  Ethan was sitting next to Jenna Weinfurt, who we&amp;rsquo;ve heard in the past, was his &amp;ldquo;girl.&amp;rdquo;  Jenny and I got to talking to Jenna&amp;rsquo;s mom, who claimed that Jenna had told her that Ethan was her boyfriend.  As those two were sitting next to each other, Jenna&amp;rsquo;s mom decided it would make a cute picture, so she positioned herself across from the two of them and focused her camera and tried to get their attention.  Jenna looked right away, ready to have her picture taken, but Ethan was interested in something else (what, I do not know, but it must have been on the floor because that was where he was looking).  After several unsuccessful attempts at getting his attention, Jenna looked at him and said, sternly, &amp;ldquo;Ethan!&amp;rdquo;  Immediately his head popped up and he smiled for the camera, for what I assume was an adorable picture.  I guess this behavior either is instinctual, or it starts very, very early.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night was Ethan&amp;rsquo;s unofficial first Christmas concert as a &amp;ldquo;grade schooler.&amp;rdquo;  He&amp;rsquo;s had a concert every year in daycare, but this is the first time he had an &amp;ldquo;audience.&amp;rdquo;  Both sets of grandparents braved the 200 mile trek to see their grandson dance and &amp;ldquo;sing&amp;rdquo; Christmas songs with his classmates.  It was a nice concert, held in the church with all the other kids in St. Bruno&amp;rsquo;s school, which includes kids through 8th grade.  It was obvious that he didn&amp;rsquo;t really know Silent Night or We Wish You a Merry Christmas, but he made up for not knowing the words by doing a little dance while the rest sang.  It was pretty cute.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Life should be filled with more days like today.  It was one of the most relaxing, yet fulfulling days I&amp;rsquo;ve had in quite awhile, and will not be soon forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It started out last night, really.  The whole family went to Kohls to do a little &amp;ldquo;midnight&amp;rdquo; Christmas shopping.  OK, it was actually about 7:30 when we went, but for all intents and purposes (from Ethan&amp;rsquo;s standpoint) it was close to midnight.  After fulfilling many of our gift purchasing obligations we went back home and watched the first 20 minutes of Sky High, a movie about pubescent super heroes.  It&amp;rsquo;s a great movie, and I had a hard time making Ethan turn it off at 11:00 to get him to bed&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>First Birthday Party</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ethan had his first non-family birthday party on Sunday.  It was for Robert Dent, a boy from his daycare, who was turning five.  They had the party at M&amp;amp;M Gymnastics in New Berlin and it involved doing some tumbling and eating pizza.  Looked like fun.  Mostly, though, it reminded me how old Ethan was getting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ethan also got to spend the day with our friends Micky and Tim on Saturday as Jenny and I had to go to a wedding.  Apparently he was a very good boy, and even helped Micky setup her Christmas village.  We were happy to hear that he was a good boy since it is always difficult to leave your child with friends and have them remain your friends for too long.  He was very excited to go to their house, but for a strange reason.  Jenny bought Ethan a shirt and tie for his upcoming Christmas concert.  The shirt came with a tie, and she also bought him another, more Christmas-looking tie to go with it, so he had two ties.  He was really excited to have a tie, but one of them was quite a bit too small for him.  So he decided that Jacob, Micky and Tim&amp;rsquo;s 2 year old son, would like to have a tie as well.  Ethan wore his tie over there, on a t-shirt, and apparently spent the better part of the first hour over there trying to convince Jacob that he should wear the other tie.  Jacob did not agree, so Tim ended up having to wear the tie&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Ghost with One Black Eye</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ethan told me a story today.  He asked me, &amp;ldquo;Daddy, do you want to hear a scary story?&amp;rdquo;  I of course said I did.  After which I was delighted to hear the story of the ghost with one black eye.  What impressed me the most was his sense of theatrics while telling the story.  He had different voices that he would use for the different characters, and whenever he was getting to a &amp;ldquo;scary&amp;rdquo; part, he would whisper very quietly.  It was one of the best stories I&amp;rsquo;ve ever heard, though I&amp;rsquo;m not sure I could ever retell it as well as I heard it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m sure I’ve been more proud of Ethan, but I can’t remember when.  Tonight Ethan showed me that he can snap his fingers.  About a week ago he showed me that he could whistle…  I think it was a couple of weeks ago that he had asked me on separate occasions how to whistle and how to snap your fingers.  I showed him what I knew, but ultimately, it is hard to teach somebody how to do something like that.  I told him to keep practicing, and he did.  He practiced, and practiced, and practice.  The payoff started about a week ago with whistling, when he finally figured out the right aperture for his mouth to make a sound.  Now, a week later, he is whistling tunes.  Then tonight, he finally figured out to snap his fingers.  I think he may have gotten some encouragement from his Grandma Grady, but he did it.  He said he wanted to do it, he couldn’t at first, but he kept at it until he finally did it!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the past couple of days, Ethan has started doing a couple of remarkable things (in my opinion).  He has a pair of roller blades that he got from our friends Maylee and Jason last Christmas.  A couple of days ago he decided he was going to put them on, and now he&amp;rsquo;s skating all over the house.  It&amp;rsquo;s really fun to watch him skate from wall to table to stairs all over the first floor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday marked the first snow of the season.  Unlike most years when it snows for the first time, this snow stayed on the ground.  Ethan was so excited this morning to see snow.  His eyes lit up and he exclaimed that &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s almost Christmas!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we went to the Badger/Hawkeye game, a thing we intend to do each year.  Todd and Theresa, my uncle and aunt who live near Madison, offerred to watch Ethan for the day.  He had a fine time, and the Hawkeyes won the game much to many a Madisonion&amp;rsquo;s chagrin.  Ethan has always gotten along very well with Julia, the older of Todd&amp;rsquo;s two children, but lately he has been doing more and getting along very well with John, Julia&amp;rsquo;s younger brother.  John, who is a year younger, is taller and bigger than Ethan.  They really have started getting along very well together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ethan has been saying some funny things, lately.  First, since it&amp;rsquo;s been Halloween season, he has seen the Grim Reaper walking around on TV and on the streets.  He has been calling him the &amp;ldquo;Grim Reefer&amp;rdquo; however.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other funny thing he has done lately is to sing the song Tootsie Roll.  There&amp;rsquo;s just something funny about a 4 year old singing &amp;ldquo;Let me see your tootsie role&amp;rdquo; to me&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Kalahari in the Dells</title>

      <guid>http://dogsbuttbrew.com/reclaimed/kalahari-in-the-dells/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We went to Wisconsin Dells with the Abholds on Thursday afternoon. My parents obtained a free night stay since they were treated badly at the Kalahari. They gave us the free night stay, so we traded it in for $129 off of a suite. Not a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you’re not familiar with the Kalahari, it is a huge hotel and conference center with a large indoor and outdoor water park attached. We’ve taken Ethan to this water park in the past when my parents were staying there, but this is the first time we’ve stayed there ourselves. The first thing we did when we got there, then, was to put our swimsuits on and head over to the water park. Ethan’s first order of business was to run around like a crazy person in the wave pool. This kept him occupied for a half an hour or so, but soon he decided we had to explore the other regions of the water park. After a minimal amount of searching, we found the kid’s area with an immense rain structure surrounded by fiberglass animals and water slides. Now this was fun. Ethan started out going down the smaller slides and playing around the fiberglass animals. After awhile he discovered a slightly bigger slide that he was happy to go down for quite awhile. All the while Ethan was vaguely aware of some bigger slides on the other side of the structure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to call this year Ethan&amp;rsquo;s first Halloween.  Sure he has had four other Halloweens, but this one was special.  It was the first time that he actively participated and enjoyed himself.  He is growing so fast it is unbelievable, and I don&amp;rsquo;t mean he is getting tall.  Instead of being afraid to go to any of the houses, he actively pointed out the houses that he wanted to go to based on what kind of candy he thought they would have.  In fact, he had been scouting the houses out for the week leading up to the day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
