      <description>&lt;p&gt;Vacation just isn&amp;rsquo;t vacation until there&amp;rsquo;s a trip to the E.R. So today officially started our vacation!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This afternoon was pretty nice outside. It was around 60 degrees, not too much wind, so the kids went outside and played baseball. They were chasing the balls all around the property, including through some longer brush and what-not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a long day of playing, and a long night the night before, Quin was pretty tired. So around 7:30 we decided it was time to start what we thought would be a quick descent into sleepy time, starting with a bath. It was your typical bath, even though it was in a strange tub. Once he got out and was drying off, Quin was feeling around and discovered something strange on the underside of his &amp;ldquo;special purpose.&amp;rdquo; He showed it to me, and I confirmed - a tick!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
