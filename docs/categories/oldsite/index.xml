      <description>Vacation just isn&amp;rsquo;t vacation until there&amp;rsquo;s a trip to the E.R. So today officially started our vacation!
This afternoon was pretty nice outside. It was around 60 degrees, not too much wind, so the kids went outside and played baseball. They were chasing the balls all around the property, including through some longer brush and what-not.
After a long day of playing, and a long night the night before, Quin was pretty tired.</description>
