        <section class="panel-body">
          <p>For some reason, Quinton has decided lately that he wants to be an actor. He feels
he could be rich, and feels that he&rsquo;s every bit as good as the people he&rsquo;s seen on
TV and movies.</p>
<p>Yesterday on our trip back from Colorado Springs where we were watching soccer,
Quinton was going into great detail about what would happen when he&rsquo;s an actor. First
I told him that he&rsquo;d probably need to hire an agent. He said fine, but when I told
him that he&rsquo;d have to pay one, he changed his mind. Eventually he decided that he
could just have me be his agent. I&rsquo;m sure he figures I have great Hollywood
connections and would make a great agent. Of course, he wouldn&rsquo;t have to pay me&hellip;
When confronted with the fact that I would still need to pay for things, he came up
with some clever thoughts. I could live with him, for one thing. Jenny and Mireille
would still live in our house, but he and I would live in his mansion. Then we could
have a Mustang to drive around in since we wouldn&rsquo;t have anybody else to drive
around, and he doesn&rsquo;t intend to have a girlfriend or anything. He did say we could
get a truck - you know, for long trips&hellip;</p>
<p>When I asked him how I would just buy things that I need or want, he had an answer
with that as well. He said I could buy things. As long as I didn&rsquo;t spend money
stupidly, like buying a fan when we already had ceiling fans!!!</p>
