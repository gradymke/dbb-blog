          <p>As a sort of late birthday present, a few of our Wisconsin friends came out and
enjoyed a ski weekend with us at Copper Mountain, the resort where we have our
season passes. Tim Z. was the first to arrive on Friday afternoon. After
dropping off the dog, then picking Tim up from the airport, we headed west
through typically terrible Denver traffic - perhaps leaving at 4:30 was a poor
decision. Nevertheless, we made it to our hotel by around 7:00 after only
having to stop once for snacks and toilets.</p>
<p>As an aside, I saw this picture on the way to picking up Tim at the airport.
It&rsquo;s a little weird living in a city that is this crazy about their football
team when that team is not the Packers&hellip;</p>

<p>After checking in, we headed downtown Frisco for a burger and a couple of
beers. The late shift started after supper when Ethan and Quin watched cable
in the hotel room while the adults went to meet Maylee, Steve, and some of their
friends in Copper Village for a couple more drinks. All in all, it was a late
end to the night, particularly for Tim who came in from the Central time zone
that morning. All told, we were sleeping by midnight - including the kids!</p>
<p>The skiing was wonderful. Quin spent the first day in riding school (don&rsquo;t call
it ski school, he is a snowboarder!). The theory was that Jenny and I could do
some &ldquo;serious&rdquo; skiing while he learned some tips from people that could actually
teach him to board. Ethan hung with us for most of the day. It was a pretty
good day of skiing all around. The temperature at the bottom of the hill was
around 40 degrees Fahrenheit. If not for just a little bit of a wind towards
the top, it would have been impeccable conditions!</p>
<p>Ethan has blossomed into a very competent skier. True to his personality, he
is good enough to not look dumb, but not adventurous enough to get himself into
any troubles, which is very much like how Jenny and I approach skiing. He is
young and coordinated enough to get <em>very</em> good at the sport, however, should
he choose to do so.</p>

<p>Maylee introduced me to this cool app that tracks your progress throughout the
day, so in the interest of social networking, here are the results as
tabulated by the app <a href="http://www.corecoders.com/applications/ski-tracks/">Ski Tracks</a>.</p>

<p>After a grueling day of skiing for old folks like us, we gathered Quin from
riding school and met up with the Abholds at their condo for some supper and
a couple of beers. That merriment was pretty short lived, however, as we were
all pretty beat from so much fresh air and exertion, so the Gradys and Tim
went back to our Frisco hotel about 6 miles away and drifted off to sleep
somewhere between 8:00 and 9:00 PM.</p>
<p>The next day I had Quinton. I was dreading it a bit since it would mean I
couldn&rsquo;t do exactly what I wanted to do at exactly the time I wanted to do it.
Instead, I had to hang out with Quinton while he learned to snowboard. We
headed over to the green area near the Union Creek lift because there is a lot
of really good, achievable terrain over there, and we had a blast! I realize
now how selfish I was behaving, when in fact, this investment in my time to
help him get more confident on the hill is even more selfish in the long run.
This investment will make a ski buddy for me for years to come! He&rsquo;s only been
out about three times on the hill at this point, and I am completely amazed at
how far he&rsquo;s progressed. He&rsquo;s very confident on the board. He can pretty much
make it do what he wants it to do. It doesn&rsquo;t always look pretty, but you
can see flashes of good form in there. What really amazed me about how
Quinton (and remembering back, Ethan did as well) learns is how he doesn&rsquo;t
freak out about anything. I see a lot of adults trying to learn to ski or
snowboard, and they just are a lot more tentative and frightened all the time.
There were times when Quinton was surrounded by a lot of other skiers and
snowboarders, many of which were not confident on the snow, and he just rolled
with it. I was a very proud dad on Sunday.</p>
