        <section class="panel-body">
          <p>Sorry, no cute stories about Quinton and the funny things he says today.
No interesting tales about Ethan and his quest to become a driver one day
in the next year or so&hellip; Today I thought I&rsquo;d take an aside and post a public
service announcement on the <a href="http://sourcefoundry.org/hack/">&ldquo;Hack&rdquo; font</a>.</p>

<p>Why do you care? You likely do not. However, if you&rsquo;ve found this post and are
still reading, let me tell you why I like Hack.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a minor font geek for years. Not of the type that designs fonts,
getting down into the details of the placement of pixels within a square or
anything like that, but I definitely appreciate a nice font, and I have
historically found myself changing over the fonts I used from time to time
just to see if there was one I liked better for different occasions.</p>

<p>In the last year, a few fonts have been released that have made me really
&ldquo;excited.&rdquo; First there was <a href="https://developer.apple.com/fonts/">Apple&rsquo;s San Francisco Font</a>,
which they created as a typeface specifically for their watch. They liked it
so much that they have since promoted it to all of their mobile devices for
default display. Google also introduced <a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2015/09/01/google-created-an-entirely-new-typeface-for-its-snappy-logo-redesign/#gref">Product Sans</a>.
I don&rsquo;t know as much about the history of this font, but it was very much in the
same vein as Apple&rsquo;s effort from what I can gather.</p>

<p>Much of what I like about fonts has to do with printing on a page, and that&rsquo;s
probably the most prevalent use of them overall. I know my wife, for one, has
been a big fan of <a href="http://www.dafont.com/jester.font">Jester font</a> for several
years. I&rsquo;ve had some fun at her expense on that one&hellip; An area of increasing interest
to me is fonts for use in programming, though. These fonts are somewhat special
in that it is almost always better to have a non-proportional font, meaning
each character inhabits exactly the same width on the screen as all other
characters. This is in contrast to non-proportional fonts, where each character
takes up only the width that it needs (<em>i</em> takes up less space than <em>w</em>, for
example). In programming, horizontal space typically matters, at least from
the standpoint of how the developer perceives the code. Indentation and spacing
is something to which attention is paid.</p>

<p>There are a number of programmer favorites when it comes to non-proportional
fonts. <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Inconsolata">Inconsolata</a> and its
variants have been a staple of mine for some time. Of course there&rsquo;s always
Courier, which is a staple on many systems. In the past year, though, Hack has
been released to the world, and is now my go-to font for all monospaced text
situations.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to say what I like about it better from a style perspective. It looks
great, but I couldn&rsquo;t tell you why. From a non-subjective standpoint, though,
I like that it is open source and free. I&rsquo;ve heard rumblings about the great
font wars where people will steal other people&rsquo;s work and call it their own.
Fonts are a highly contested area, for some reason - people that design them
are artists&hellip; Hack, though, since it is open source and free, there are no
flame wars or court battles - everybody can use the original, for free, for
any purpose.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you are somebody who uses monospaced or non-proportional fonts on a
somewhat regular basis, I encourage you to give Hack a try.</p>
