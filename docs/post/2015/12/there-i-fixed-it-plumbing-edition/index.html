        <section class="panel-body">
          <p>One of these days I will get around to posting the epic project that we&rsquo;ve
undertaken of redoing our kitchen. It&rsquo;s been about 4 months in the making and
we&rsquo;re hitting the final stretch! Last week the countertops were installed
so we finally got our new sink installed. Unfortunately, the countertop guys
don&rsquo;t do plumbing, so that&rsquo;s my job!</p>
<p>I had budgeted three trips to the hardware store, and I was right on the
money! The problems I had to deal with in this particular plumbing experience
were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The new sink is DEEP! 10&quot;, and mounted below the countertop. This is
in contrast to the old sink which was 8&quot; and mounted above the countertop.
Since gravity needs to do work in plumbing, it was going to be close. I was
unsure if I would be able to make the garbage disposal work in the
configuration.</li>
<li>The new sink has a single drain centered in the sink. This doesn&rsquo;t seem
like much of a problem, but it ended up being quite difficult.</li>
<li>The dishwasher was setup to drain into a garbage disposal, which has a
3/4&quot; input port. I was pretty sure I wasn&rsquo;t going to be able to make a
garbage disposal work, meaning the dishwasher was going to have to drain into
the sink drain directly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Excited to get everything setup, we went to Home Depot on Friday night and got
the stuff that I <em>thought</em> I would need to hook it up. Here was what I was
able to do with that stuff.</p>

<p>So, back to Home Depot at 8:45 on Friday night. This time I got this accordion
looking P-trap that allowed me to &ldquo;float&rdquo; the 1 inch difference between
the drain tail pipe and the wall pipe. But it looked <strong>ugly</strong>. I wish I had a
picture of it - but I was so angry at it by this time, I didn&rsquo;t even think to
take a picture. Let&rsquo;s just say it sort of <em>worked</em>, but it looked terrible.
And the &ldquo;soak test&rdquo; that I performed to it uncovered a very slow leak.</p>
<p>I was on the fence as to whether I should just throw in the towel and call a
plumber, but I had one more attempt in me. This time, I went to Ace Hardware,
my secret weapon in the DIY space since people are much more knowledgable and
helpful. There I got what I think was the secret sauce. My problems that I had
to overcome - the height of the P-trap was just a little too low because of
the dishwasher in-port on the tailpipe&hellip; Also, the drain was still just an
inch off of where the tailpipe could reach. What I really needed was a deeper,
longer P-trap (or J-trap, not sure which is appropriate).</p>
<p>Well, such a thing didn&rsquo;t exist at Ace - I&rsquo;m not sure if it does exist in
plumbing circles, but I ended up piecing together a solution that is working
(knock on wood). What I ended up having to do is get a 45% angle piece that
was threaded on both ends, then get another wall pipe. After cutting one of
my wall pipes down to about 4&quot; straight into the wall, connecting that to the
45% coupler, then cutting down the other wall pipe to just the bend, I was
able to find an angle that made it all work together.</p>
