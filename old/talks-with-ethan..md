It sometimes frightens me to think what Ethan tells people about us. He and I are sitting in the car waiting for Jenny and mom to come out of a store and he's telling me about how he and a girl from school have made up new words to a song that I had made up when I was a kid. Or was a parody to the tune of "this is it" by Huey Louis and the News called "Smell my Pits.". I probably shouldn't be telling him some of te things I tell himâ€¦<br /><br /><br />-- Post From My iPhone<br /><p class='blogpress_location'>Location:<a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=S%20Signal%20Butte%20Rd,Mesa,United%20States%4033.382419%2C-111.602190&z=10'>S Signal Butte Rd,Mesa,United States</a></p>
