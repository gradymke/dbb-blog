      Show image as background to text. You can't really calculate the width
      reliably in JS because margins are not taken into account by any of
      clientWidth, offsetWidth or scrollWidth, so we don't force a minimum
      width if the user is using shrink to fit.
      This results in a margin-width's worth of pixels being cropped. If the
      user is not using shrink to fit then we expand the header.

href="http://dogsbuttbrew.com/"&gt;DogsButtBrew.com&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/h2&gt;It's with some degree of excitement that I announce that I am retiring e-and-quin.blogspot.com. Over the years, the Blogger platform has served me well. It has captured many memories that I enjoy reading and re-reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, I'm not giving up blogging. In fact, I'm doubling down on it! I'm just giving up on Blogger. As I said, it has served me well, but my interests have moved on. I wanted something that I could have better control over, something I could call my own. Oh, and I already owned the DogsButtBrew.com domain name and was paying for hosting... That site was in desperate need of a refresh. Combine that with a need to rejuvenate the blog, and you have the relaunched &lt;a href="http://dogsbuttbrew.com/"&gt;DogsButtBrew.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plan is to continue to post whimsical things about my kids, but to expand the content to some of my other interests, like movies, beer, gadgets, programming, and the like. If you are a long-time reader of this blog (all 6 of you), you will still find that content at the new place. You will also likely find a bunch of stuff in which you have no interest, and that's OK. The new platform should help you to see only the stuff that is interesting to you in an easy to navigate fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So head on over there. This will be my last post to this site. In the near future, I will be pulling the content from this blog and re-posting it on the new platform so you can view all of the past content that was available here on the new site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="http://dogsbuttbrew.com/"&gt;One More Big Link in case you didn't click on one of the ones from above.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/8882756472356203875/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=8882756472356203875' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/8882756472356203875'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/8882756472356203875'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2015/11/new-blog-home.html' title='New Blog Home'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KFjLHzL29sY/Vj4gEO98FEI/AAAAAAAAsUQ/N2Zq2OahBYM/s72-c/woodcut_dogs_transparent.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-5974970435194481299</id><published>2015-09-24T10:41:00.003-05:00</published><updated>2015-09-24T10:41:23.547-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Glenwood Springs, CO</title><content type='html'>A few weeks ago (well, over a month ago now), we took a trip to Glenwood Springs, CO. It was a trip to celebrate the end of summer and to get away for a little bit before the kids started school the next week. It was a nice long weekend, though the traffic coming down from the mountains left little to be desired.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At a high level, we walked around, went on some long bike rides along the Colorado River, visited a wild west theme park on the top of a mountain, took a cave tour, and did the hike at Hanging Lake. For anybody looking to go to Hanging Lake, here are my recommendations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get there early, or park at a rest area to the WEST and bike or walk to the trailhead. We biked - it worked great.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take LOTS of water. We didn't...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is a fairly difficult hike, particularly at the top. Mentally prepare yourself for that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is much longer than you think. Mentally prepare yourself for that.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;Rather than blather on about it, I made this short video composed of pictures and video that we took on the trip. Hope you enjoy it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;iframe width="320" height="266" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J8lTYZZKvLk/0.jpg" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J8lTYZZKvLk?feature=player_embedded" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/5974970435194481299/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=5974970435194481299' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/5974970435194481299'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/5974970435194481299'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2015/09/glenwood-springs-co.html' title='Glenwood Springs, CO'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J8lTYZZKvLk/0.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-8637749495798962569</id><published>2015-08-27T13:48:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2015-08-27T13:48:42.705-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>So... We moved to Colorado...</title><content type='html'>In case you haven't been following the blog... Er, wait...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we moved to Colorado. We've been eyeing a move up for awhile. This was the year to do it when Ethan was transitioning to High School and before Quin got too entrenched in his activities and the area. So we set out to do something new, and Colorado won out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that allowed us to do all of this was a company that decided to hire me as, get this, the Executive Director of Technology. Cool title, eh? IQNavigator is the company, and by now I've been working there a little over 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The house thing was a very interesting ordeal. Once I had the job offer and we knew Colorado was going to be the landing place, we set out to identify the right school district, and from there we would work in concentric circles to find out where we would live. Different things led us to select Aurora as our ultimate landing place, and the Cherry Creek School District as where our children should go. OK, so shouldn't be a big deal, right? Just pick houses in our price range and footprint requirements with Smoky Hill as the High School. Well, Denver was about to deal us a surprise. Apparently they are in the midst of a "housing crunch." Allegedly there are typically 22000 houses in the "inventory" for people to purchase, but today they average only 4000. I guess people are moving to Denver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we took a different tactic. We retained a Realtor, and had her send us new listings that matched our criteria every day. We had a decent hit one day early, so we asked Maylee to go over and check it out. She said it was OK, so we thought we'd see what we could do. By the time we talked to our Realtor again, the house was gone... OK, so it was going to be something we had to act quickly on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward 2 weeks, we still haven't seen any houses that even match our criteria to look at. How were we going to get to LOOK at a house and select whether we would live there or not!??! Finally one day a house came on the market that matched our criteria. Maylee, our friend who lives in Denver, was able to come over on her lunch break and check it out, Skyping me all the while, and by that evening we had put an offer for asking price on a house. I like to say that we bought our house on the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a trip to visit the house for the first time (on Mother's Day) at the inspection, I admit, I was doubtful. Denver had just experienced a rare May snowstorm, and the neighborhood was recovering from the aftermath of having heavy snow covering the trees. I was also a little skeptical of the house. It could have had something to do with the 9 beers I had the night before, but there were some things that were a little sketchy about it. More on that for another day...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 13 rolled around - I was scheduled to start my job the following Monday. I drove the Malibu to Denver starting later in the afternoon, leaving my family for a planned two weeks before I flew back to drive them to their new home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The home closing went OK, though it had to be delayed because I "didn't have a job" for the duration of a weekend. Banks sort of suck. Luckily Maylee and Steve had a spare bedroom and a soft spot in their heart, so they let me stay with them and home base from their house for a couple of days while I waited for the bank to verify that I did, indeed, have a job. Once closed, I moved my blow-up air mattress into the empty, scary house, and started our new life as Coloradans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weeks without the family went excruciatingly slowly. I wish I had been blogging during that time as I'm sure it would have been very dark. I was sure I was going to be murdered in my home in this new "urban" setting. I figured unsavory gangs were wandering the streets at night just looking for open windows or unlocked doors so they could come in and wreak havoc on the occupants and the dwelling. Luckily, as per normal, reality turned out to be much more mundane. Our neighborhood is very nice with very friendly people. In fact, we live in the midst of many retired couples (not too unlike our neighborhood in Summit), which means that not much happens in the neighborhood that they don't see. They're home all day long, except when they are on one of their many, many vacations!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jenny and the boys stayed home to pack the house, arrange to have all of the fixes made to it that the new owners demanded, and basically close up our lives in Wisconsin. One night Jenny was talking with Quin and they were feeling sorry for me spending time all by myself in a new city. Quin had some sage advice for me, however, that Jenny relayed to me. He said if I wanted to make friends in a new town, I should just go up to somebody that looked like I might want to be friends with and say, "Hi, my name is Brandon. Do you want to be friends? Would you like to have a beer sometime?" It's weird how some people have things all figured out at such a young age. Maybe we all do and we forget it as we get older and over complicate things. I hope he can hold on to it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward two weeks, our stuff arrived on Friday morning. That afternoon I flew back to Milwaukee, had a party, rented a UHaul, packed the WAY too much stuff we had left into it, hooked it up to the Flex, and headed west on Saturday around noon. The drive was pretty uneventful (thankfully). We stopped in Kearney, NE to stay the night, then descended on our new home in Aurora, CO early in the afternoon on Sunday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's been about 2 months since then by now, and they've gone by in a blur. I'm only going to be able to hit the highlights and perceptions for the most part. Hopefully I can use this post as a platform for smaller updates with pictures in the future. Jenny keeps nagging me about it, so it might happen. In fact, one thing that I've been doing a LOT more of since I got here is writing, though it's more of the journal variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the house is mainly unpacked. The kids took some time to adjust. The first two weeks consisted of a lot of "I miss home," and "Colorado sucks more than Wisconsin" talk. Blaine came out to visit and deliver the dog that he'd been taking care of. One thing I've noticed in the first two months is that it has become much more special to see family and friends from home than it was when we were "nearby." I suspect that will continue. My parents just left, in fact, after helping us out while Jenny traveled out east, and it was probably the most enjoyable visit I've had with them since they visited us in Seattle. Distance certainly puts perspective on things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jenny did a great job of getting the kids involved right away. Ethan started soccer workouts with the Smoky Hill High School team almost immediately, so he met some people that he can talk with. 2 months later and now he "has people to eat lunch with," which is a big concern for high schoolers. He is doing very well in High School so far. He made the Junior Varsity team and has his first game tonight. I will likely blog more about that as the season progresses as I find myself being one of those annoying parents that tries to live out my high school dreams through my son - I shall try to avoid that. I think I can achieve the balance! Oh, and he also was able to test into two Honors classes and a Sophomore math class. He's doing very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quin got to attend some YMCA camps with lots of cool field trips. He met some kids and started doing Pokemon with them (I don't think he plays correctly). He also developed a deep love for Jenga. He's started school now, which is literally down the street from our house. We can see the school from our front door! He is doing very well in school. At this young age, the difference between having a full day of kindergarten plus a whole year of K4 seems to have made a big difference. He's ahead of his class so we're hoping we can continue to challenge him and keep him engaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Public school is a bit of an adjustment for us. For one, the sheer numbers of kids is overwhelming sometimes. Since school has only been in session for about two weeks, it's difficult to say what the curriculum is going to be like. We read a lot of articles about how schools are being ruined by policy and what-not, but we've always been able to distance ourselves from that. Now we'll have to jump into the party and hope for the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For their part, the kids seem to be doing just fine with school. Ethan did mention that one unexpected thing happened the first day of school. He said the only public displays of affection he witnessed were between couples of the same sex... Oh, and Quin has had a quick immersion into the public school lifestyle as he told me the other day that "two kids were talking about sex at recess today. Dad, what's sex?" It's like a setting for a Norman Rockwell painting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're all adjusting to a world where all of our friends of 20 years are not around to talk with all the time. I miss having that more than I expected I would. As time moves on I'm sure we'll make new friends, but we were very lucky with what we had in Wisconsin and that will likely not ever be replaced. In a way, though, we feel like the time invested in moving (which was considerable) has resulted in a time savings in a way as we had about 8 weeks of relative free time. I'm sure next summer will be a different story - this school year is already proving to be a scheduling challenge!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I'm rambling. I didn't even mention the two awesome mountain hikes and one mini-vacation that we've done, but I'll try to cover some of that in subsequent posts. We're also busying ourselves with immersion into home improvement projects again, so new windows and new kitchen cabinets... Again, more material for a future post.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/8637749495798962569/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=8637749495798962569' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/8637749495798962569'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/8637749495798962569'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2015/08/so-we-moved-to-colorado.html' title='So...

I feel bad, but I was looking forward to this in some ways. Over the last 5 days, Mireille has turned into a typical 2 year old, and taking care of 2 year olds is HARD! Particularly by yourself. Luckily, when you have nothing else to do, it makes it much easier. It's much easier to completely invest in what the child is saying and doing, which I did - once I got done showering, washing the dishes, and packing (I'm such an adult).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night was wonderful, for the most part. Mireille was super tired, but got restless around 11:00. So I gave in quickly and put her in bed with me. Both she and I fell asleep almost instantly and didn't awake until around 6:45. We kind of lazed around for 45 minutes or so - I can tell she's my kind of girl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 7:30 we got out of bed, brushed our teeth, and got some breakfast. Eggs, toast, and other assorted sundries. I got rid of much of what I had bought, but still had quite a bit to give away to the foster family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a quick shower (which Mireille again watched with interest), we both got dressed, then waited… Natasha and Elisa were supposed to come by 9:00, then Papa John by 10:00. So we hung out. First we made a video to show Quinton the hotel. It was a pretty good one. Then we just played. Mireille brutally killed an ant with her shoe, which is one of the cutest things I've ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After catastrophically murdering all ants within her reach, she turned her focus to the fly that was pestering us in the room. I was sitting on the door threshold, waiting for Natasha and Elisa, and Mireille would come over to me, then look at the fly, then say “Dee Doh” and chase after it, stomping her foot, then running back while giving a big belly laugh! This literally lasted for an hour… Again, this is something I need to consciously do with my kids in the US - it's the kind of time that I just never carve out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;iframe width="320" height="266" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/s_vi/gQq1H3XqJM8/default.jpg?sqp=CLDwvqcF&amp;rs=AOn4CLBqjAkUyGDhHl-dIAijpJG-2bADDw" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/gQq1H3XqJM8?feature=player_embedded" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While playing and getting full belly laughs, I started to pick up on some phrases. I have no idea if I have them right, but they sounded like the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I dee dow - or I get down - when she's on my lap and wants to get down.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here we go! - this is something she says when I, or something is in her way and she wants to get past. My leg was in her way to get into the room, so she would say “Here we go” and I would move it. Probably something in Lingala, but that's what it sounded like to me.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Around 9:45, Natasha and Elisa showed up to much fanfare. I don't know what I thought would happen - I guess I thought Mireille would be happy, ecstatic even, but she wasn't. She was better than she was when they dropped her off with me, but she kind of just drew back into her shell, the thumb went directly to her mouth, and she got very reserved. Natasha and Elisa don't speak much (any) English, so we all just sort of sat there for an hour while we waited for Papa John. During that time, Mireille went to both Natasha and Elisa, but then came back to me. Eventually she continued to play with me, and I found myself feeling a little badly for Elisa. She seemed like she really was looking forward to seeing Mireille, but Mireille sort of wanted to hang with me… I get it - it's sort of like having a cool uncle. I am the cool uncle. I am the one that does whatever she wants whenever she wants. I am the one that dedicates every waking hour to her every whim… Why wouldn't she like that. But I felt bad for Elisa…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Jcmep-VYCi4/VOdW9I8PtkI/AAAAAAAAi_U/WcvW4Bn_iWw/s1600/IMG_1398.JPG" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Jcmep-VYCi4/VOdW9I8PtkI/AAAAAAAAi_U/WcvW4Bn_iWw/s1600/IMG_1398.JPG" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-z86S5TK7trU/VOdW-L9S3_I/AAAAAAAAi_c/g0d8Qhu3Ne0/s1600/IMG_1399.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-z86S5TK7trU/VOdW-L9S3_I/AAAAAAAAi_c/g0d8Qhu3Ne0/s1600/IMG_1399.jpg" height="320" width="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;Papa John eventually came and we began parting ways. Mireille screamed when they took her away, which I have mixed feelings about. On one hand, she clearly bonded with me. On the other hand, she is forced to go through so much change all the time!!! I suppose it's good for kids, but man did it hurt. I cried - a lot. In fact, I've continued to cry up to now, and will likely to so some more before all is said and done. What a wonderful gift and curse all at once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Papa John took me downtown to the Air France depot there. In Kinshasa, since the airport is rather small, they do checkin downtown. So he took my passport and led me through the basically simple procedure of checking my bags, getting my boarding pass, and paying my $55 exit tax. All in all it was pretty painless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that, we went to get some Chawarma sandwiches, which Papa John treated me to. They are a middle eastern thing, from what I can tell, that have chicken, french fries, cole slaw, all in something that looks like a tortilla. It was pretty good! They were supposed to have Pilee Pilee in them, but I didn't taste it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We got a couple of Chawarma sandwiches for the road then went to meet Papa John's girlfriend, Joyce, and to take her some lunch. She was just as young as reported, and very beautiful. She greeted and said goodbye to me with a kiss on the cheek, which made me feel very European.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We headed out of town so we wouldn't have to worry about traffic. Good thing, too, traffic was bad! It took an hour to get to the Kinkole fisherman village, which is probably about 15 miles past the airport. On the way we encountered several “funeral cars” which are just SAAB station wagons with caskets in the back. Apparently Kinshasa's cemetary is past the airport - and that's the only cemetary. It was busy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kinkole was everything I would have hoped a small village would be. People everywhere, but a nice restaurant and good music which sounded Caribbean, which I suppose makes sense. Papa ordered us a couple of beers and some fish cooked in leaves, big leaves. He was excited to take me here since I am the only American he's met that can handle the hot Congolese food. While we ordered, he flirted with the waitress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fv6tPMplF8I/VOdW_O5BtuI/AAAAAAAAi_k/QUXsft-fTKI/s1600/IMG_1401.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fv6tPMplF8I/VOdW_O5BtuI/AAAAAAAAi_k/QUXsft-fTKI/s1600/IMG_1401.jpg" height="320" width="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;iframe width="320" height="266" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/s_vi/NUZDCErvqqQ/default.jpg?sqp=CLDwvqcF&amp;rs=AOn4CLCeEzspgU_pU_Q_3tFET5phElcnPw" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/NUZDCErvqqQ?feature=player_embedded" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vismuRhi1Vw/VOdZGh3LAvI/AAAAAAAAjCM/jpiP-1WwEoI/s1600/IMG_1410.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vismuRhi1Vw/VOdZGh3LAvI/AAAAAAAAjCM/jpiP-1WwEoI/s1600/IMG_1410.jpg" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hdBAFavROCg/VOdZgzXgL9I/AAAAAAAAkM4/coqJZAtAJsg/s1600/IMG_1414.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-hdBAFavROCg/VOdZgzXgL9I/AAAAAAAAkM4/coqJZAtAJsg/s1600/IMG_1414.jpg" height="320" width="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5OxwAuOx44w/VOdZf0KCgtI/AAAAAAAAkMo/2AiFoTmocYw/s1600/IMG_1411.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5OxwAuOx44w/VOdZf0KCgtI/AAAAAAAAkMo/2AiFoTmocYw/s1600/IMG_1411.jpg" height="320" width="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;While we were waiting for our fish, many street vendors came to our table. I bought a map of Congo, which I hope makes it home! As I type it is up in the overhead compartment, just waiting to be crushed! We were also offered live grubs (called Macoco?), something that looked like termites, shoe shine, shoes, baskets, and some seasoned crickets, which Papa John got for us and I ate! They weren't bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lx87EHAsg2M/VOdZntD0xBI/AAAAAAAAkMA/xqc5IL5UBJU/s1600/IMG_1405.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lx87EHAsg2M/VOdZntD0xBI/AAAAAAAAkMA/xqc5IL5UBJU/s1600/IMG_1405.jpg" height="320" width="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our fish was delicious, served with plantains. It was a bit spicy and served in humungous leaves in a broth with onions and peppers. Quite tasty! The fish was right from the river and still alive when we ordered it. I think it was called a Mapongo fish…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yJg2aAi6-_U/VOdZo6LRS_I/AAAAAAAAkMY/pQEhTx0JvYY/s1600/IMG_1408.JPG" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yJg2aAi6-_U/VOdZo6LRS_I/AAAAAAAAkMY/pQEhTx0JvYY/s1600/IMG_1408.JPG" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;After our lunch and 2 beers we went further west into the real bush to a place made by one of Kabila's generals to be a resort. Anybody can come, but it is heavily protected by armed guards and a gate/fence. It was beautiful. Here we had a great view of the Congo river where it was wide. There were several sporting boats out doing boat things, like water skiing and some jet skis as well. It was a beautiful afternoon, we each had like 5 beers each. I have a feeling Papa John was getting a little drunk by the time we left. More on that for the aforementioned beer or two that you can buy me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Around 5:45, we left for the airport, which was about 30 minutes away. There I met Norbert (who's first name I can't recall) who guided me through the complexities of the N'dgjili International Airport, of which I am grateful. After that, it's just sitting around, thinking on what a week it was, crying quite a bit, and texting folks to see how they are doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm now sitting on the airplane waiting for my first 8 hour leg to begin. I hope all the beer is out of me, as I hate to get up a lot on the plane just to pee. I also hope I sleep… I've gotten used to the time zone in the days I was here, sort of unfortunately since it only benefited me one day while I was here! I'm really looking forward to getting home and spending time with my boys and Jenny. Of course, I think often about my week with Mireille. How she would grab anything that was flat on one side, put it to her ear and say “hallo!” Natasha says she likes to say “Hallo, kakeka” when she's talking to one of the other little girls in her foster home, Rebecca. It makes me sad… I know she is being well cared for here, I can see that. But it's not something that can be sustained… I see that now. Even if we pay for foster care through her 18th birthday, she is living in a country with 10% employment (I didn't say unemployment) and few opportunities for anybody to really put themselves in a better place. We need to get her to the US, for selfish and unselfish reasons - it's the only thing that makes sense. I've distilled my requirements into these two points:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I want to bring her to the US as soon as possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I want to be able to bring her and the rest of the family back to Congo to visit someday…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/2506817289438248875/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=2506817289438248875' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/2506817289438248875'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/2506817289438248875'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2015/02/the-great-congolese-caper-day-8-on-way.html' title='The Great Congolese Caper - Day 8 - On the way home'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://i.ytimg.com/s_vi/gQq1H3XqJM8/default.jpg?sqp=CLDwvqcF&amp;rs=AOn4CLBqjAkUyGDhHl-dIAijpJG-2bADDw' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-820484397651454585</id><published>2015-02-23T11:41:00.002-06:00</published><updated>2015-02-26T18:13:43.389-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mireille'/><title type='text'>The Great Congolese Caper - Day 7 - Kinshasa</title><content type='html'>&lt;b&gt;Kinshasa - Day 6&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting down to it! Today I'm nervous again, but that hasnt changed much from day 1 here, or day -2 for that matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night started out rough. Mireille was restless. She didn't fall out of bed, but was up like 3 times up until about 1:00 AM. She didn't cry or anything, but she got out of bed and asked me to hold her. After rocking her to sleep the other two times, I convinced her to just sleep in my bed with me the last time. That ended up working very well. She settled down and was completely out in short order. Her only requirement seemed to be that she had one foot touching me somewhere. That forced me to settle down and not be so uptight and nervous as well, so we both got a good night's sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 7:00 we woke up and did our ritual. On a side note, and with the bad habit discussion from a couple of days ago in mind, I've been giving Mireille fruit snacks on a somewhat regular basis. If it were up to her, she would eat fruit snacks and bananas and drink only orange Fanta. Bad parenting aside, the way she eats fruit snacks is hilarious. She shoves all but one of the snacks into her mouth as quickly as she can chew and swallow them. Then for the last snack, she takes the tiniest of bites and makes it last for 10 minutes or more. She REALLY likes them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today was a Papa John day. Nothing special - we just wanted to get some souvenirs for taking home. Papa John came in cowboy regalia today. He was happy from having made up with his girlfriend the day before. She loves him again. There's plenty more to this story, but for the rated R version, you will most certainly have to buy me a beer or two!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first place we went was to a closed market that Papa John called the handicapped market. I figured it was just a translation mistake, but when we got there it was indeed the handicapped market. All of the people there were disabled in some way, and the goods were made by the handicapped. I ended up purchasing a nativity, which I hope makes it home without breaking (it didn't), and a black doll with cool hair for Mireille, though she doesn't like it, so I'm taking it home in hopes that someday she will like, or at least appreciate dolls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next market we went to was the more traditional type. The vendors were pushy and it was close. All of the stuff there was more or less the same as what was at the handicapped market. I ended up buying some musical instrument, which I can't remember the name of, a beer truck for the bar, and some Congolese paintings that I thought were cool. I'm sure Jenny will have other opinions, but it seemed like a good way to spend a little money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-len0NYhNt4g/VOdZyXeX4KI/AAAAAAAAjHU/AKE-Jho_UsY/s1600/IMG_7567.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-len0NYhNt4g/VOdZyXeX4KI/AAAAAAAAjHU/AKE-Jho_UsY/s1600/IMG_7567.JPG" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;I asked Papa John to then take me somewhere to buy some soccer jerseys for the boys. He drove through the commercial part of town to a corner, pulled to the side of the road, talked to a guy, and within a minute there was another guy asking for the boy's ages. He told the guy, who went away and came back with two jerseys and shorts. They don't really look big enough, but they are definitely cool. As soon as we got them, Mireille demanded that I put not one, but both of the jerseys and both of the shorts on her! I convinced her to take them off before we got to our next destination, however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VeNQNDyCaoU/VOdZ8lyDfmI/AAAAAAAAjIk/I14BALlsr5Y/s1600/IMG_1368.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VeNQNDyCaoU/VOdZ8lyDfmI/AAAAAAAAjIk/I14BALlsr5Y/s1600/IMG_1368.jpg" height="320" width="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;We then headed over to the other side of the river where the fishing village was, which was interesting. We stopped at a restaurant on the river where Papa John had made up with his girlfriend the day prior. We ordered a couple of beers and a Fanta. He insists that the next time I come here we rent a boat and go out on the river where there are tiger fish, crocodiles, hippos, and all sorts of things that can kill you. Sounds like a fun trip, but at $400 for the day, it seems like I might need to recruit a friend to help me defray costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;iframe width="320" height="266" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/s_vi/vLSp4xUblrQ/default.jpg?sqp=CNjrvqcF&amp;rs=AOn4CLCEO442tXF3rXyjBXmsc9-tn_StSw" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/vLSp4xUblrQ?feature=player_embedded" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the way back to the hotel we stopped and got some pilee pilee, a pepper spread that we've eaten a couple of times down here. It is very hot and delicious, so I wanted to take some home for any of my hot food eating friends, which I must admit I don't have that many of - maybe Tim Ziegler will partake with me while I make him watch the hour or more of video and photos I've taken of Congo and Mireille!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back at the hotel, the neighbor Andrew was waiting around in the courtyard until his driver came to take him to the airport. I invited him in for a couple of beers and we chatted for quite awhile. We hung out for a couple of hours, when he ultimately had to leave for the airport for his long journey home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andrew left, Mireille got CRANKY, but it turns out we didn't really eat any lunch, and that girl does not miss too many meals. So I managed to cook a meal while holding her on my hip, no small task. Once she had eaten she was sweet and happy again, after a nice poop of course. She even sang to her mom on the phone a little bit. She loves cell phones. She holds things up to her ear and says “hallo,” which she did while Jenny was on the phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After supper, I cleaned up, put Mireille down a little early since she had a negligible nap at lunchtime, then packed my bags, which are considerably lighter than when I came here. Tomorrow is a long day prior to finally disembarking for my flight back to the US via Paris.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I sit here, mentally preparing and unloading for the emotions of tomorrow, I'm watching Cine + Star, a French language station. I'm watching some movie - not sure what it is, but this one, and the other French movie I watched this past week both had gratuitous boob scenes, which is making me appreciate French cinema more than I ever could have guessed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1lqfZWjWLLo/VOdaDXXZpEI/AAAAAAAAjJk/yjRCUkmOT9I/s1600/IMG_1377.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1lqfZWjWLLo/VOdaDXXZpEI/AAAAAAAAjJk/yjRCUkmOT9I/s1600/IMG_1377.JPG" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6UwUJuISY4U/VOdaFnwxdeI/AAAAAAAAjJ0/dsBu2e2kDBk/s1600/IMG_1379.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6UwUJuISY4U/VOdaFnwxdeI/AAAAAAAAjJ0/dsBu2e2kDBk/s1600/IMG_1379.JPG" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-p7UNpO_eDLo/VOdaJTSIEZI/AAAAAAAAjKU/AqLVlNDAfRY/s1600/IMG_1383.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-p7UNpO_eDLo/VOdaJTSIEZI/AAAAAAAAjKU/AqLVlNDAfRY/s1600/IMG_1383.jpg" height="320" width="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lJY0VrglzKc/VOdcAYIxj7I/AAAAAAAAjKw/QdUgeSQB9UM/s1600/IMG_1388.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lJY0VrglzKc/VOdcAYIxj7I/AAAAAAAAjKw/QdUgeSQB9UM/s1600/IMG_1388.jpg" height="320" width="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/820484397651454585/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=820484397651454585' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/820484397651454585'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/820484397651454585'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2015/02/the-great-congolese-caper-day-7-kinshasa.html' title='The Great Congolese Caper - Day 7 - Kinshasa'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-len0NYhNt4g/VOdZyXeX4KI/AAAAAAAAjHU/AKE-Jho_UsY/s72-c/IMG_7567.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-2350788999197496944</id><published>2015-02-23T11:29:00.002-06:00</published><updated>2015-02-26T16:40:19.291-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mireille'/><title type='text'>The Great Congolese Caper - Day 6 - Kinshasa</title><content type='html'>&lt;b&gt;Kinshasa - Day 5&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a hotel day - all day at the hotel. It's a good and a bad thing. Getting out would be nice simply to stave off the boredom, but it also allows for a very concentrated, focused time for just hanging out with your child - something I'm not sure I ever did so much with the boys, or at the very least don't do it anymore…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today started out much better than the last few, mainly due to the fact that I got a full 8 hours of sleep under my belt, which was sorely needed! Mireille even cooperated for the most part. She did fall out of bed around 11:00, which caused passed out me to catapult from the bed, vaulting both my iPad and iPhone onto the floor. I have a smallish dent on the corner of my iPad, which is the only thing I can see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once Mireille woke up, she looked over at me - I was up. She came over and crawled into bed with me for a couple of minutes, which was nice. Then we leisurely got up, brushed our teeth, and started breakfast. Today we had eggs, cooked in vegetable oil with cheese, a big difference from a couple of days ago. We also tried toast in the oven instead of frying it in a frying pan - way better. I'm getting better at this Kinshasa thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After breakfast, we just kind of hung out in the room. All day. We tried to swim once, but Mireille is terrified of the pool. She also goes into a shell pretty much any time we leave the room, the left thumb going directly into the mouth. Later in the day she did manage to start coming out just a little bit outside, but it's a slow process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highlights from the day - Mireille is quite the little blabber mouth once she gets going. All (or most) of her phrases are Lingala, though, so I have no idea what she's telling me. Occasionally she gets upset with me, but eventually just points or walks me to what she wants and eventually gets her way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started writing down the phrases that I hear from her and when she says them. Here is a sampling:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;bu tu nana te (pointing across the room)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;ma (when handing me something)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;do dah doh (singing)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;bee doh (more singing - kind of like the Minions)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;matoh (hot?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;She continues to be excellent at disassembling the pantry and reassembling it on the floor somewhere. She also LOVES to take out little snacks, give them to me, then steal them back from me before I can eat them. This gives her much amusement. She doesn't so much laugh as she shows a wry little smile and peeks at me out of the corner of her eye. She's a stinker!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After lunch I was doing the dishes, somewhat of a tradition now. I prepare the meal while getting Mireille to start eating something cold, then I eat quickly and help her to eat some of the more difficult parts, then I do the dishes while she destroys the room. Tonight the dishes are unwashed and will remain that way until the morning - I'm spent! Anyway, while doing the dishes, I couldn't find one of the spoons that I knew we had used. I looked around a bit but didn't see it anywhere. I really wanted to find it, especially since Sunny Day is out one of their plates after Mireille decided it no longer needed to exist as a whole plate any longer. Just dropped it right on the tile - well, really threw it. Ah, love 2 year olds! A few hours later, going at the pantry yet again, I hear a clink in one of the items she's playing with, a ceramic tea pot. Sure enough, the spoon was in there. She loves to hide stuff from me - she must know I am an easy target for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the topic of spoons, she has an interesting way of eating. She actually has quite a bit of manual dexterity and fine motor control. When she eats, she likes to use a spoon. She easily scoops up rice and whatever into her spoon, but then things start to get complicated. She sits so low on the chair that it's difficult to get a good angle. So she slowly brings the spoon to the space between her mouth and the table, then takes her other hand, puts it on the back of the spoon, then turns it all sideways and propels it to her mouth. She occasionally gets one or two grains of rice to successfully end up in her mouth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had planned to video chat with the boys and Jenny before school, which is 2:30 Kinshasa time, so I tried to get her down for a nap right after lunch. It was very hot, so after I changed her, I just left her in her diaper and nothing else for her nap. Well, not nothing else, I suppose. She demanded that I put her shoes on first! The picture is pretty funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cgb_adt6CJU/VOtiqB0vFAI/AAAAAAAAkWM/lfcbJEw7i-4/s1600/IMG_1364.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sq8JcZ9yRFk/VOdek8AF3VI/AAAAAAAAjMY/y8IHSCD24v8/s1600/IMG_7557.JPG" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Shoes for a nap? Why not!&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;While she napped, I quickly took a shower, then finished up the dishes I was unable to finish from earlier, then I went outside in hopes of wrangling a decent internet signal so I could feed the addiction. After about 5 minutes I heard a baby screaming - just SCREAMING. I assumed it was the neighbor since his daughter has been doing that all week for the most part. After a few seconds I realized that it sounded deeper than Blanche's cries. I ran inside to find Mireille standing on the floor simply besides herself. I imagine there's still a significant amount of separation anxiety and trauma she is experiencing, and maybe always will… She luckily is easily calmed - I apologized profusely, but paid for it the rest of the day where I was not allowed anywhere 2 feet or more from her until now, while she's asleep for the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After our successful FaceTime call with Jenny and the boys, we tried the swimming pool once again - fail. OK, pools aren't for this girl just yet. So we went back and spent the rest of the day in the room for the most part. I gave her a bath, which was surprisingly easy, once again. She is a VERY beefy little girl and has a prodigious stomach. While I was drying her off I got a picture to show Jenny when we get home. It's quite impressive, actually. I was surprised to find out that she is not only a willing participant in the lotion ritual, she actually likes to help out. She demanded that I keep filling her hand with lotion, then she would clap her two hands together, then wipe them somewhere on her body. It's actually much easier to lotion her than it is to lotion Quinton (infinitely easier than lotioning Ethan:)) One other thing that she makes very easy is getting her dressed. She knows how all of the things go and knows how to balance herself for each part. I suppose 2 year olds do this, but I was impressed nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For supper I ordered the La Poeta pizza from “Kinshasa Pizza Company” (I made the name up, I'm not actually sure what the name is). The neighbor, Andrew, his daughter, Blanche, and us shared it. It's Andrew's last night in Kinshasa. I feel bad for him as he has pretty much been at the hotel the entire time since his ground transportation has been completely handled by his agency. I think I've convinced him to hire Papa John the next time he's in town. The pizza was actually quite good. We even managed to get them to deliver us a couple of beers - Heineken, but I can't be picky. Actually it tasted wonderful in the hot weather, tasting just a little bit of home (despite it being an imported beer, yeah, I get it)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cgb_adt6CJU/VOtiqB0vFAI/AAAAAAAAkWM/lfcbJEw7i-4/s1600/IMG_1364.JPG" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cgb_adt6CJU/VOtiqB0vFAI/AAAAAAAAkWM/lfcbJEw7i-4/s1600/IMG_1364.JPG" height="320" width="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;O Poema Pizza from Kinshasa Pizza Company&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;Tomorrow is another adventure with Papa John, which I'm looking forward to. After that I have to start thinking of packing for the two of us and prepping for Mireille's departure on Saturday morning. I'm sure she will probably be excited to see Elisa - that will make me happy, but also a little sad. It seems like we've made a lot of progress this week and there's no way to know how much longer it will be before we get to see her again…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aside, I'm writing this in my journal, DayOne, which tags the messages with the Lat/Long coordinates. It sort of makes me giddy to see 4.3… deg S. That's South of the Equator. And only 15.2… deg E. East of the Prime Meridian. That's almost the origin of the world from a graphing perspective!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;iframe width="320" height="266" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/s_vi/VPcLqY8fORY/default.jpg?sqp=CJS_vqcF&amp;rs=AOn4CLDRnLGSlSM1hVuCb0wS1krEkVObTQ" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/VPcLqY8fORY?feature=player_embedded" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/2350788999197496944/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=2350788999197496944' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/2350788999197496944'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/2350788999197496944'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2015/02/the-great-congolese-caper-day-6-kinshasa.html' title='The Great Congolese Caper - Day 6 - Kinshasa'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sq8JcZ9yRFk/VOdek8AF3VI/AAAAAAAAjMY/y8IHSCD24v8/s72-c/IMG_7557.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-8126632586270484026</id><published>2015-02-23T09:36:00.003-06:00</published><updated>2015-02-23T09:36:22.463-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mireille'/><title type='text'>The Great Congolese Caper - Day 5 - Kinshasa and Surrounding Areas</title><content type='html'>&lt;b&gt;Kinshasa - Day 4&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad habits I'm already allowing my daughter to develop, because, hey, she's under a lot of stress just hanging out with me. I hope I'm not setting myself up for bad things later:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drinking soda - this is a big no-no for the sub-40ers in our household, but Mireille has already had soda every day I've been with her. She likes it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not brushing her teeth - it's difficult enough to get her to open her mouth for me, much less brush. She has finally started using the toothbrush herself, but she does a terrible job at brushing…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Holding her until she sleeps - I'm pretty sure I broke my boys of this habit prior to them being 30 months old. I actually think it could be developmental progress in that she's regressing to a more infant state. My guess is that she didn't get a lot of personal attention as an infant, and perhaps craves it now. I'm happy to provide it, though it is frustrating at times to try to set her down and sneak away before she wakes up. Raising a two year old is hard!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Today started out fairly badly again in that I just cannot seem to get to sleep at a reasonable time! Despite only getting 2 hours the night before plus a 2 hour nap, I still could not fall asleep until after 4:00 AM local time (9:00 Central, coincidentally). I imagine by the time I leave I will have adjusted better to the time change - just in time to screw it up again. At least there I will have full access to my modern diversions and drugs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mireille got up around 7:30, thankfully, so I managed to get around 3 hours of sleep. As I sit here at 8:30 PM watching her sleep, I don't feel any fatigue. I'm worried I may start hallucinating soon, though. Hopefully tonight improves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After brushing our teeth, we sat down for a quick breakfast. Today I tried to make toast in a frying pan. It didn't work too badly. So I had some peanut butter toast, Mireille had just buttered toast, and we both had cereal. Mireille also tried some applesauce, but didn't like it. Breakfast is really not her thing…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plan for the day was to meet Papa John and go to see the Lola Ya Bonobo preserve. After the rough couple of nights of sleep, I considered calling it off and just doing something around the hotel. I didn't, and I am glad that I made that decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After breakfast, Mireille and I sat outside to chill while we waited for Papa John. It was a steamy one today, even by 8:00 when we got out there. Our neighbor had already left for the US Embassy to file his I600, the main purpose for his trip. After a few minutes, a group of people, two white people and two black, approached us. The white couple was probably in their early 60s and the woman was carrying a black child. Initially I thought it was Blanche, the next door neighbor's child. I figured that they were watching her as he had mentioned something to the effect of his agency providing nanny care while going on “adult trips.” Turns out it wasn't Blanche, it was some other 1 year old that the white couple were fostering. They are permanent residents and missionaries in Congo. Their work centers around adoption and they were at the hotel to meet up with some family. Maybe they were just looking for families that were there and talking with them, I'm not sure, but I had a nice conversation with them before Papa John showed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Papa John entertained the missionaries, Mireille and I went into the room and got ready for the day. I briefly thought about shorts as Papa John was wearing them, but decided against it in the end and am happy I did. Both Papa John and Mireille got bit by mosquitoes on their ankles, but my pants prevented me from suffering the same fate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Lola Ya Bonobo Center is several miles south of the city. The drive there was crazy as expected. On the way through town, Papa John stopped at a local supermarket to get a water and some snacks. He bought us some fried meat and potato things that he called subrimas (I think I'm getting that wrong) which originated in India - these were the local version, and they were delicious. He bought two each for him and myself and one for Mireille. In the end, Mireille ate two and I ate one, though I could have eaten a lot more of them - they were delicious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took at least an hour to get to the Bonobos. At one point we transitioned from the city to the country and it was noticeable. The road, previously paved, turned to dirt, and there were farms lining both sides of it. The people there all seemed to be working very hard, digging sand from the creek or planting vegetables. Once on this road it still took another 20 minutes or so, despite the fact that we probably only traveled 5 miles on it. I was nervous at several points, but never as much as when we had to go high up on the left side of the road because the right side was completely washed out. I swear his car only had half a wheel on each side on the road!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Against all odds, we arrived at the Bonobo sanctuary unharmed. We  parked, the only car in the “lot” and walked toward the entrance when  Papa John told some folks doing some work in the area something in  French. When I asked him, he told me that he told them to tell any young  punks that tried to wash his car while he was in there to not even  bother, otherwise they were going to do it for free. Amusingly, when we  left, somebody had washed his car and was standing there waiting for him  to pay him. He just got in the car and started to drive away, slowing  briefly to roll down his window and shout at the kid. He said he is a  “teacher.” How is he supposed to keep his car clean on this road!??!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The  bonobo exhibit was very cool, though nothing near as cool as the trip  to the exhibit. Seeing the country and large sections of the city is  very interesting and eye opening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We stayed at the Bonobos for  about an hour. I purchased tickets for Papa John and myself (Mireille  was free) for $15 (total). That gave us access to a French speaking  guide, Marseille, a skinny, young Congolese man who clearly loved what  he was doing. The tour was pretty short. We walked down a path, stopping  a few times to observe some bonobos in their areas. They had 4  different areas with bonobos - two family areas and two areas for  younger bonobos. All of them slept indoors on hammocks. There was a lot  of good information about how they only live in DRC because they can't  swim and they are surrounded by water where they live. The sanctuary  gets all of their bonobos as orphans as people in that part of the DRC  shoot adult bonobos to eat, which I found pretty disgusting. All told  there are 71 bonobos at the sanctuary. One interesting tidbit, the  bonobos entire hierarchy is based on sex, which they like a lot. They  use it for pleasure or for showing dominance. And they don't  discriminate against who they have sex with, which Papa John found  pretty amusing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While we were walking on the trail, Papa John  started chatting up Marseilles, at one point he exchanged phone  information with him. One thing I've noticed a lot of is cell phone use  in this country. Papa John says that many Congolese actually have 2 cell  phones for when one of their networks is not working. It is also the  reason many businesses list two phone numbers in advertisements. Anyway,  it was interesting to see him at work and is likely one of the reasons  he is an excellent guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zB5iCPRCA4k/VOj1DUcuzyI/AAAAAAAAjrg/x4jAdbyTAs4/s1600/IMG_7473.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zB5iCPRCA4k/VOj1DUcuzyI/AAAAAAAAjrg/x4jAdbyTAs4/s1600/IMG_7473.JPG" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jtObjFxFmQg/VOj1AVJeVYI/AAAAAAAAjrM/RRR3aAql1x0/s1600/IMG_7471.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jtObjFxFmQg/VOj1AVJeVYI/AAAAAAAAjrM/RRR3aAql1x0/s1600/IMG_7471.JPG" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-a6EIMoAoxO4/VOj08WO1WuI/AAAAAAAAjq8/ABLV88xUJa4/s1600/IMG_7469.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-a6EIMoAoxO4/VOj08WO1WuI/AAAAAAAAjq8/ABLV88xUJa4/s1600/IMG_7469.JPG" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wOpi6MWaBnU/VOj1G_3vhEI/AAAAAAAAjrw/hH7gPxwFfTo/s1600/IMG_7475.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wOpi6MWaBnU/VOj1G_3vhEI/AAAAAAAAjrw/hH7gPxwFfTo/s1600/IMG_7475.JPG" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aETKRkLedkI/VOj1M56GXfI/AAAAAAAAjsM/kN89tZiujKs/s1600/IMG_7478.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aETKRkLedkI/VOj1M56GXfI/AAAAAAAAjsM/kN89tZiujKs/s1600/IMG_7478.JPG" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZDFed0wCtsg/VOj1Q-nUnlI/AAAAAAAAjsc/OuvR0Qu8-yg/s1600/IMG_7480.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ZDFed0wCtsg/VOj1Q-nUnlI/AAAAAAAAjsc/OuvR0Qu8-yg/s1600/IMG_7480.JPG" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PzGTA0eUmD0/VOj1YaFVQSI/AAAAAAAAjs0/-SPvVgn683Y/s1600/IMG_7483.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PzGTA0eUmD0/VOj1YaFVQSI/AAAAAAAAjs0/-SPvVgn683Y/s1600/IMG_7483.jpg" height="320" width="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IV7Zp0y03Sk/VOj1lo9vi2I/AAAAAAAAjts/jMtWKaPdCPg/s1600/IMG_7490.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IV7Zp0y03Sk/VOj1lo9vi2I/AAAAAAAAjts/jMtWKaPdCPg/s1600/IMG_7490.JPG" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ydLAgIXhyyo/VOj1vSr7EKI/AAAAAAAAjuM/aYCJJIDux-g/s1600/IMG_7494.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ydLAgIXhyyo/VOj1vSr7EKI/AAAAAAAAjuM/aYCJJIDux-g/s1600/IMG_7494.jpg" height="320" width="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RJSfbrO84Xc/VOj2Ew7_IUI/AAAAAAAAjvs/YbNBx9q4qzM/s1600/IMG_7506.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RJSfbrO84Xc/VOj2Ew7_IUI/AAAAAAAAjvs/YbNBx9q4qzM/s1600/IMG_7506.jpg" height="320" width="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the way to the youth bonobo areas we saw three pallets of vegetables set out which we were told was the bonobos lunch. Papa John didn't know the word for cucumber, so I told him. While we were walking away, I noticed him practicing the word several times, which also struck me as how he is able to be so conversant in so many languages. Very impressive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SPF-iSMBTAA/VOj11wO8xkI/AAAAAAAAjus/Yd6gHsSwJJY/s1600/IMG_7498.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SPF-iSMBTAA/VOj11wO8xkI/AAAAAAAAjus/Yd6gHsSwJJY/s1600/IMG_7498.JPG" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;We spent about another 20 minutes observing the youth bonobos in two separate groups. Each area had one or more caregivers to socialize with them since none of them had mothers. I found it very interesting that they had women there who were supposed to socialize with these animals like a daycare center. None of the women appeared very engaged - I'm not sure how long they sit in the pen with them, but it seemed like something they just do. The bonobos would occasionally interact with them, but the older ones mainly ignored their caregiver, who carried a bamboo switch to dissuade any of them that got any funny ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-P2mp5hmlUd0/VOj19B5OgtI/AAAAAAAAjvM/vhpk-4fYDj0/s1600/IMG_7502.JPG" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-P2mp5hmlUd0/VOj19B5OgtI/AAAAAAAAjvM/vhpk-4fYDj0/s1600/IMG_7502.JPG" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the bonobos, we went back out on the country “road” but stopped short and headed south to the Mal Valle Lake (may not be correct). This is a lake that is owned apparently by the Catholic church. It was quite beautiful down there and very peaceful. You couldn't even hear a car or anything - the only thing we could hear were the water, birds, and the guys burning extra bamboo nearby. We got a little lunch with the flies and Papa John and I had a beer - I finally got to have a Tembo and it lived up to the hype. Here, Papa John once again showed his worth as he literally knew everybody at the lake. I'm not even sure it was open as the gate was locked when we got there, but a honk and a wave from him and they opened it up and let us in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2HrwYxlp6x8/VOj2q2PTIfI/AAAAAAAAjyU/x8_NpQzgZ4I/s1600/IMG_7527.JPG" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2HrwYxlp6x8/VOj2q2PTIfI/AAAAAAAAjyU/x8_NpQzgZ4I/s1600/IMG_7527.JPG" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-stUNoE7vLm0/VOj2Jqj8pZI/AAAAAAAAjwE/6iroIjV2LvI/s1600/IMG_7509.JPG" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-stUNoE7vLm0/VOj2Jqj8pZI/AAAAAAAAjwE/6iroIjV2LvI/s1600/IMG_7509.JPG" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dPWQqkPci48/VOj2Nk_pSKI/AAAAAAAAjwc/b_dw9YGfXY0/s1600/IMG_7512.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dPWQqkPci48/VOj2Nk_pSKI/AAAAAAAAjwc/b_dw9YGfXY0/s1600/IMG_7512.jpg" height="320" width="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ou7VROBHLI0/VOj2O1IaASI/AAAAAAAAjwk/-As79L0FZ5Q/s1600/IMG_7513.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ou7VROBHLI0/VOj2O1IaASI/AAAAAAAAjwk/-As79L0FZ5Q/s1600/IMG_7513.jpg" height="320" width="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kYj1DQfBJS4/VOj2VoGJkFI/AAAAAAAAjw8/y0DZs6lvpb8/s1600/IMG_7516.JPG" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kYj1DQfBJS4/VOj2VoGJkFI/AAAAAAAAjw8/y0DZs6lvpb8/s1600/IMG_7516.JPG" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;On the way back I had Papa John take me to ShopRite so I could get some more bananas and some oil to hopefully improve my cooking. I'd been trying to cook with margarine, which is all they have here, and it's terrible. I spent about $2 to get half a liter of vegetable oil and it makes a big difference! While I was there, I also stopped at the pharmacy to get something to help me sleep a little better. While explaining that I would like Tylenol (they don't have it), one of the pharmacy techs took one look at Mireille and gave me a couple of free samples for some medicated lotion for her extremely dry skin. That was a little embarrassing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mireille took a little nap in the car on the ride back, which sort of sucked because I couldn't use the time for showering. She didn't get a lot of sleep, though, so she was a little cranky. One thing I've noticed is that she poops a little after noon most days (that I've known her, anyway). When she has to, she gets very cranky, then wants to be held for no apparent reason. Once she's done, she turns into one of the sweetest little girls you could imagine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little later in the afternoon, back at the hotel now, I was sitting outside when the neighbor came out and started talking. He asked if I wanted to share a beer with him. Never one to back down from a beer, I happily accepted and went in to get my last beer from the fridge. I feel bad for Andrew - he's had a VERY rough week. While his daughter, Blanche, is very interactive and sweet at times, many other times she is very difficult to deal with. She cried almost the entire day that day, apparently, and wouldn't let him do anything to try to comfort her. She just wanted to sit on the bed and cry. I hope it gets better for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With oil now in hand, I fried up a passable steak and rice supper, which is apparently Mireille's favorite meal. She sort of picks at her breakfast and lunch most days, but the last two days she's completely shoveled down her supper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mireille is now full 2 year old, blabbering Lingala phrases rapidly and smiling and dancing. Oh, and she loves goldfish crackers, but only to dump them on the floor then to put (most of) them back in the bag, then repeat. That's really her favorite game, from what I can tell. This pretty much is what happened until bed time around 8:00. It wasn't too difficult to put her to sleep - it was a bit difficult to actually put her in bed and have her stay there, however. All in all I think it took like 20 minutes to get her to sleep and stay in the bed, which isn't so big a deal - what else do I have to do? Oh, I think King Tuna is on Nat Geo again - better get right on that! I wonder if tuna.com pulls in the biggest haul yet again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Amusing Papa John stories from the day:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I'm finding is usual, I had a very interesting and insightful day with Papa John. Some of these stories may be elsewhere in my post, but I am so enthralled with this guy that I think it deserves to be written twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On our way to the Bonobo Reserve, Papa John told me about his girlfriend. She was texting and calling him but he wasn't calling. He said he is done with her, she only wants his money! He says, “Congolese women, all they want is your money. Are American women like that?” I told him there are some, of course, and we call them “Gold Diggers.” I figure I did my part to educate this man for the next tourists!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have yet to go somewhere where Papa John didn't know either everybody there, or at least one person. At the Bonobo Reserve, we had a tour guide that he didn't know. John spent most of his walking time getting to know the guy and exchanging phone numbers. He's definitely a student of his craft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other stories I have for the day are probably not suitable for the written word, but as always, buy me a beer sometime and I'll happily share!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/8126632586270484026/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=8126632586270484026' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/8126632586270484026'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/8126632586270484026'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2015/02/the-great-congolese-caper-day-5.html' title='The Great Congolese Caper - Day 5 - Kinshasa and Surrounding Areas'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zB5iCPRCA4k/VOj1DUcuzyI/AAAAAAAAjrg/x4jAdbyTAs4/s72-c/IMG_7473.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-3881275423095869182</id><published>2015-02-22T08:45:00.001-06:00</published><updated>2015-02-26T10:09:36.579-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mireille'/><title type='text'>The Great Congolese Caper - Day 4 - Kinshasa</title><content type='html'>&lt;b&gt;Kinshasa - Day 3&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, I met my daughter! Yes, I met her yesterday, but that version of Mireille was guarded, afraid, and sullen. She's asleep now - hopefully for the night. Today we made very good progress, and I am beyond excited!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The morning started out not so well. I slept terribly last night, by that I mean I didn't really sleep at all. I fell asleep around 10:00, but Mireille fell out of bed at 10:45, and I didn't sleep after that. I was worried about her, too many things going through my head… Every time she moved a little bit, I was up and on edge. So when 5:30 rolled around, I wasn't very excited to hear her up, though I wasn't surprised since she had been asleep since 6:00 the evening before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When she awoke, she cried a little, then when I got out of bed to comfort her, she just put her thumb in her mouth and laid back down to sleep. I don't know if she actually slept, but I didn't care - I was TIRED! So I slept, a little. By 6:30, she was up, up. I got up and forced myself to make some breakfast, which she just picked at. Dry cereal and a scrambled egg. Not too interesting to her, I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After breakfast we played a little bit. I managed to get her to slap me five, which I thought was progress. Eventually we went outside and visited with the neighbor, Andrew, who is in town visiting his daughter, Blanche, and to file his I600 in country. I will probably write more about his situation in a previous post once I catch up, but it is nice having him around, being an English speaker and in a very similar situation to me. Blanche was up a few times during the night and we could hear her. While we were playing in the room, we heard her again, but this time she sounded happy and was talking! When we went outside, she was being very playful with Andrew, throwing a ball back and forth, teasing him, talking, dancing… None of which Mireille had shown any ability to do. That's when the dark feelings started to come. We had never really seen Mireille smile, and that hadn't changed since I got to Congo! Was she autistic? Did she have long standing emotional scarring that would never go away? What are we in for?!!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We decided to try swimming, which didn't go very well. It scared her, but we gave it a shot - maybe we'll try again on Thursday. A brief aside about the weather here, it's been lovely. I don't know the temperature, but it's been very tolerable, and the mosquitoes haven't been too bad yet at all. We'll see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 10 minutes in the pool, we went back to the room and got Mireille a much needed bath, which she did very well during. I don't think Elisa is using any lotion on her, because she's got some very dried skin which seemed to soak up the lotion I applied. I'll have to make sure I send that with her on Saturday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the bath, she was tired! I don't exactly remember how it transpired, but by 11:00, Mireille was asleep. I wanted badly to call Jenny to tell her that we could maybe get Mireille out of the country for special needs due to psychological trauma or something. It was very difficult seeing the neighbor's daughter, a full year younger, interacting and playing just like you would expect a kid to behave. But, since it was only 4:00 AM where she was, I opted instead to read and ultimately took a nap myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I awoke, it was 2:00, and Mireille was still asleep. After a couple of minutes, she woke up and we had some lunch. I made grilled cheese sandwiches for us, a banana and sweet potatoes for her, and some grapes for me. She didn't think much of the sandwich, content to just play with it and make a big mess. She absolutely devoured the banana, though, and eventually ate her way through the sweet potatoes. It was the first measurable amount of food she had eaten since arriving at Sunny Day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After lunch we found out that Mireille loves books! We read them over and over again, then eventually she started “reading” them herself by paging through them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;iframe width="320" height="266" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/s_vi/Lv5rifEC0wY/default.jpg?sqp=CKT6vKcF&amp;rs=AOn4CLBHb4WDeh_-nHgoKTqd3uzPVhBYjg" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Lv5rifEC0wY?feature=player_embedded" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At one point she was reading the Cheerio's book for the 12th time, I decided to give her some Cheerio-like snacks to put in the book. Then I had an inspired idea, I'll bet she would like fruit snacks. And she did! I think that was the turning point, honestly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn't long after that when I started fixing supper, rice and chicken. It was a long-ish process to make, so I started early. While I was cooking, Mireille came over to the cooking area near me and started dancing and singing! I couldn't believe it! I immediately grabbed my phone, but she had stopped already. It didn't matter, I saw it, so I immediately texted Jenny, then I cried…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinking I had lost the moment, I put my phone away, but she had gotten into a mood and was very happy. She started playing with me, smiling at me, flirting with me, teasing me with her food and kicking my tickling fingers with her feet. It's like a new kid was there!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;iframe width="320" height="266" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/s_vi/J3qQI8ElSMA/default.jpg?sqp=CICGvacF&amp;rs=AOn4CLBR0f4hRc6sa3o3uSQgShaQsq5dNg" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/J3qQI8ElSMA?feature=player_embedded" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent the next hour or more with Mireille, a 2 year old who loves to laugh, spin, dance, sing, smile, play with power outlets, stack things from the pantry, empty the garbage can… Oh, I forgot to mention, she annihilated her supper, eating ALL of the rice and ALL of the chicken, much of it with a spoon. She then demanded a cookie from me, which I happily gave to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;iframe width="320" height="266" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/s_vi/qAl63kMFCoU/default.jpg?sqp=CKyIvacF&amp;rs=AOn4CLBPtrEA_SzcwC-QvHYDGR1mGLwoNQ" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/qAl63kMFCoU?feature=player_embedded" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today was a day of extreme emotions for me. I went from wondering what we were going to do with this poor girl that didn't seem to have any emotion to getting smiles and playing with the most beautiful little girl I've ever met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose you take the good with the bad - to go to bed tonight, she demanded that I hold her until she was good and asleep, which I happily did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow we see Papa John again and may go to see the Bonobos. Hard to tell what will happen, but in a way it doesn't matter - I got everything I wanted when I came here today. I saw my daughter smile - she looked happy, and that makes everything else much more bearable.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/3881275423095869182/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=3881275423095869182' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/3881275423095869182'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/3881275423095869182'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2015/02/the-great-congolese-caper-day-4-kinshasa.html' title='The Great Congolese Caper - Day 4 - Kinshasa'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://i.ytimg.com/s_vi/Lv5rifEC0wY/default.jpg?sqp=CKT6vKcF&amp;rs=AOn4CLBHb4WDeh_-nHgoKTqd3uzPVhBYjg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-7388268561373841418</id><published>2015-02-22T08:45:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2015-02-22T08:45:56.056-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mireille'/><title type='text'>The Great Congolese Caper - Day 3 - Kinshasa</title><content type='html'>&lt;b&gt;Kinshasa - Day 2&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a rough night night, I managed to get up and get myself together by 9:00, when Papa John was schedule to show up so we could go grocery shopping. By the time he showed up, though, it was 10:30. Traffic… Common problem in Kinshasa! By then, we took off to ShopRite, a local, modern supermarket, where I purchased my groceries for the week. It was a little nerve wracking buying groceries for the week, let me tell you. Normally Jenny takes care of that kind of thing! I was very surprised at the selection, though. I managed to buy some fruit (bananas and grapes), eggs, butter, milk (which they store warm - weird), bread, sardines (Papa John insisted), cookies, and rice. Apparently a lot of the Congolese diet consists of rice dishes. Either that or “Foo-foo,” something I just learned of today from my new friend Andrew!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I had showered and was ready to start my day, I met my next door neighbor, Andrew, who got in last night after I had already fallen asleep. His trip sounded WAY worse than mine. He's from Denver. From there he flew through Chicago, then London, then Istanbul, and finally Kinshasa! Something like 30 hours! He did have some good stories to tell from his flight, however, where he actually engaged some Congolese in conversation, and was able to lay out on a complete row of seats, something I didn't have the luxury of as all of my flights were FULL! Andrew and his wife already have two boys but always wanted to adopt. Andrew and his wife are 3 years into the process, but have much further to go, as he is in country to file his I600 paperwork, which I applaud them for. I'm sure I'll hear more from Andrew as the week goes on as he and I already have a lot in common - we're both in Congo meeting our adoptive daughters for the first time, by ourselves without our wives!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After returning, Papa John sat on the patio while I put the groceries away, anxiously awaiting the delivery of Mireille. They were supposed to show up at 11:00 - I think they finally did around 12:15. Natasha, the owner of the foster homes, and Elisa, her foster mother, delivered Mireille. She is SO BIG! I can't believe how heavy she is. Papa John was very impressed at how big she was! She sat on Natasha's lap for awhile. I tried to interact with her, tried to tickle her and talk with her, but she wouldn't have it - very serious. At one point she went to Elisa and cuddled up with her for quite awhile. At some point later, Papa John took control and told Elisa to give her to me - Mireille screamed! She screamed very loudly. I stayed calm, walked her around, tried to distract her. I took her around the hotel lot - showed her the falcon that they have for a pet (pretty cool, I think), showed her the swimming pool, just walked her around. After about 5 minutes of crying, she settled down and was fine, though very serious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DeYc8l5iKbE/VOjvt5PxtTI/AAAAAAAAjkQ/eBH7vO9OV-Q/s1600/IMG_1286.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DeYc8l5iKbE/VOjvt5PxtTI/AAAAAAAAjkQ/eBH7vO9OV-Q/s1600/IMG_1286.jpg" height="320" width="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CMsLt5Fvloc/VOjv2sJjwBI/AAAAAAAAjlY/9vWtjhSWgmw/s1600/IMG_1295.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-CMsLt5Fvloc/VOjv2sJjwBI/AAAAAAAAjlY/9vWtjhSWgmw/s1600/IMG_1295.jpg" height="320" width="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;After Elisa and Natasha left (while I was showing Mireille around), we went into the hotel room and just hung out. Papa John and I went to try to buy her some formula and a bottle, which is what Natasha said she uses. I'm pretty sure something got lost in translation there, because she didn't want to have anything to do with that bottle. We also weren't able to find the formula that Elisa uses, so we are going to use what she has first then see if she will drink regular milk (which, did I mention they store warm here?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, driving in Congo is very interesting indeed! Actually I wasn't as appalled as I think Papa John thought I would be as I've experienced that style of driving in Mexico and Costa Rica, but it is still interesting to say the least. Lots of horn using! But, since they are such a law abiding country, kids absolutely cannot ride in the front seat! I don't know - I found it amusing that they bothered to ensure that kids couldn't ride in the front seat, but they had very few other protections in the vehicular arena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was finally able to get Mireille to eat a banana and a few cereal things that Jenny sent. She wouldn't touch the bottle, but I think a lot of that has to do with her still being very uncomfortable. She also managed to shit herself, so I changed my first girl-baby diaper - Achievement Unlocked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At around 3:00, Papa John suggested we go see the river and he would buy me a beer. I was able to buy beer at the grocery store, but they only had Primus, which is brewed in Kinshasa. Papa John really wanted me to try Tembo, which is brewed in his province of Katanga, one of the richest areas of the country. In fact, that is the area where the Uranium was obtained to build the bomb dropped on Japan in WWII.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, we traveled to the River. The drive was as exciting as always. This time, though, we took this one road that was definitely “local,” It was a mud road and had not been graded, maybe ever. Papa John mentioned that he really needed a 4x4 - he was right! This road was terrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We stopped at a restaurant that had a pool and a bar. It was very nice. Papa John negotiated us a table which they brought out from somewhere and setup. He then ordered us some beers and a Fanta for Mireille, which she loved (don't tell Jenny). It was a very nice afternoon just hanging out on the river, watching the laborers dig up stone for concrete, observing the local animals (lizards and a python, which was caged). Mireille snacked on plantains and a little meat that PJ ordered for us - otherwise she just gulped down the Fanta that he ordered for her. It was a lovely afternoon - lots of interesting conversation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1ELqVCft-cY/VOjv64zdUbI/AAAAAAAAjl4/7K2C_PgOF0E/s1600/IMG_1301.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1ELqVCft-cY/VOjv64zdUbI/AAAAAAAAjl4/7K2C_PgOF0E/s1600/IMG_1301.JPG" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1auDu6g5x34/VOjwJYHy3KI/AAAAAAAAjnQ/IljzAcSXCUU/s1600/IMG_1312.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1auDu6g5x34/VOjwJYHy3KI/AAAAAAAAjnQ/IljzAcSXCUU/s1600/IMG_1312.jpg" height="320" width="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pNIAlgTQ3uE/VOjwPgNBPEI/AAAAAAAAjnw/AW4twYXLCQo/s1600/IMG_1317.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pNIAlgTQ3uE/VOjwPgNBPEI/AAAAAAAAjnw/AW4twYXLCQo/s1600/IMG_1317.jpg" height="320" width="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oIZ-R-sqWyE/VOjwWJ0qgOI/AAAAAAAAjoQ/dG3Y4ZUmeLs/s1600/IMG_1321.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oIZ-R-sqWyE/VOjwWJ0qgOI/AAAAAAAAjoQ/dG3Y4ZUmeLs/s1600/IMG_1321.JPG" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2i1vKvHT9BQ/VOjwX76eaTI/AAAAAAAAjog/i42fAlzykxY/s1600/IMG_1323.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2i1vKvHT9BQ/VOjwX76eaTI/AAAAAAAAjog/i42fAlzykxY/s1600/IMG_1323.JPG" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the way back from the restaurant, we traveled through the diplomat area, a very swanky area with guarded yards and nice streets. Many ambassadors live in that area. I even saw a number of people jogging for exercise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uh oh - as I type, Mireille is sleeping in the bed next to me. She is OUT! Rough day, and way off of her schedule. When getting instruction from Elisa I was told that she is not complicated at all, and that's exactly what I'm finding. She is very content, doesn't fuss much, doesn't move around much. I REALLY wish I could get her to smile, though - she's so serious… Anyway, the reason I say uh-oh is because my neighbor's daughter, Blanche, is up. She was sleeping when we got back tonight as well and he said she is having a very hard time adjusting to him. I'm not sure whether I am pleased that Mireille is quick to adjust or not. It could be that she does not attach well to people, or it could just mean that she accepts change readily. I don't know - adoption is a worrisome exercise, for sure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eVIAHLp0P5Q/VOjwein0qNI/AAAAAAAAjpg/4rYckIFTXpw/s1600/IMG_1331.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eVIAHLp0P5Q/VOjwein0qNI/AAAAAAAAjpg/4rYckIFTXpw/s1600/IMG_1331.jpg" height="320" width="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's more or less it for today, other than my ruminations on Papa John, which are included in the director's cut, some of which are included below, but others that you may have to ask me about after buying me a beer. I'm hopeful Mireille will sleep well for the night - I should probably go to sleep in case she wakes up in the middle of the night. I'm tired enough, anyway. I probably won't, though, and will go into bonus time writing out the last couple of days as well as some of my interesting conversations with Papa John.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interesting Papa John Stories of the day&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Papa John is one very interesting man. I haven't yet written of my encounter last night with him, so some of this might seem repetitive as I go back and write of my experiences after the fact. He is a very amazing individual from what I can tell. He speaks English very well, though he is not happy with how poorly he perceives his English to be. Besides English which is his “worst” language, he speaks 14 others! His primary languages are French and Swahili. He knows Lingala OK, but doesn't find it to be a very important language. Swahili is spoken in like 5 African nations, while Lingala is only spoken in part of two (Kinshasa and Brazzaville across the river).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Papa John is 65 years old, but doesn't look it. He has 5 children. A 31 year old daughter who just got married last weekend (he showed me the pictures), and 4 boys, the youngest of which is 19. All four of his boys live with him and don't yet have jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Papa John comes from the Katanga province and was born to a Zambian father and Congolese mother. He actually fought in the Katanga/Congo civil war in the 60s as a very young boy. He moved to Kinshasa in 1971 when he came here to watch the Rumble in the Jungle. He even drove me past the hotel where the fighters stayed. Definitely an event in his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Papa John makes his living on adoption. He pulls down $100 a day as a driver/guide/bodyguard (which I've found to be well worth the money). When he's not doing that, which is often lately, he arranges for trips to orphanages where he delivers food and helps families to keep in touch with their adoptive children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the funniest story about Papa John for the evening was when we were talking to Andrew, my neighbor. Andrew has obviously done more homework than I have for this adoption. He was talking about asking the foster mom to teach him how to make foo foo, a dish that apparently a lot of Congolese eat. I asked Papa John about it when Andrew was around and he said something to the effect of, “it is smelling like shit.” He prefers rice! I later found out from him that foo foo is a starch that is utilized like rice, but it's made of corn meal and some other plant (casava?). They are mixed then boiled. He thinks people should make concrete out of it instead, but then only if they wanted their concrete to smell like shit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/7388268561373841418/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=7388268561373841418' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/7388268561373841418'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/7388268561373841418'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2015/02/the-great-congolese-caper-day-3-kinshasa.html' title='The Great Congolese Caper - Day 3 - Kinshasa'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DeYc8l5iKbE/VOjvt5PxtTI/AAAAAAAAjkQ/eBH7vO9OV-Q/s72-c/IMG_1286.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-325449672839393916</id><published>2015-02-22T08:44:00.004-06:00</published><updated>2015-02-22T08:45:56.049-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mireille'/><title type='text'>The Great Congolese Caper - Day 2 - Kinshasa</title><content type='html'>Kinshasa - Day 1 - Airport to the Hotel &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was happy when I landed in Paris that I finally got a text message back from my guide, Papa John. That made me feel much more comfortable about landing in Kinshasa, seeing as how I’ve read many bad stories about the experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is 6:30 local time on Sunday evening as I land, and it is completely dark already. Since I was in the middle of the plane, I didn’t get a good look at the landing, but what I could see, there didn’t seem to be too many lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We disembarked the airplane at N'djili International Airport (FIS) down mobile stairs directly to the tarmac where we were herded into shuttles and driven to the immigration building. The immigration building was a little intimidating, though nothing nearly as scary as what I have read. Sure, there were many people in berets openly carrying weapons, but they were all very friendly, or at least uninterested, and mainly tried to move traffic along in an efficient manner. I did witness one French guy arguing with the customs official and then one of the soldiers. I’m not sure what he forgot or didn’t have, but they were giving him a hard time. While in line I met an American business man who had traveled to Kinshasa in the past. He said that they will occasionally ask to see your letter of invitation, a requirement for obtaining a visa to get into the country. I didn’t have mine, since it wasn’t returned to me after providing it to the Embassy in D.C. to obtain my visa. So that had me a little worried. He said if they asked for it, just play the dumb American, which isn’t too difficult, it turns out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After presenting my passport and having my visa scrutinized without too much trouble, I was herded into the line where they look at your Yellow Fever card, a requirement for foreigners to travel freely in the DRC. After that rather painless experience, it was off to the luggage area, but not before having one more person scrutinize my passport. This one had me worried because he looked, then gave it back to me, then asked to look at it again. I had heard and read stories about how officials will occasionally mess with you to try to get bribes. It seemed like this guy was going to do that to me, but I kept calm, tried to hide any fear I had, and it apparently worked and he stopped messing with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the luggage area, I met Norbert, or at least that’s what I came to call him because I can’t remember his actual name. I think that was his last name! He had my name on a sign that he was holding, and I was happy to see him there!!! It meant I was probably going to make it to my hotel after all!!! We waited for about 20 minutes while my luggage made its way to the terminal, then headed out to where my guide was waiting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had texted Papa John once I got off the plane and he was waiting at the airport for me as promised. Norbert ushered me through many throngs of people all offering to do one thing or another for a tip. I kept my head down and followed Norbert about 200 yards to where I first met Papa John, my guide for the week, who was wearing a Kansas Jayhawks t-shirt, jeans, and a cowboy hat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid Norbert and tipped the kid who pushed the cart for me, then loaded up my stuff into Papa John’s 2008 (year is an estimate) Toyota Tercel, then made my way around to the left side of the car and got in the front seat. That’s right, the car had the steering wheel on the right side, like in Britain. This made for some good conversation right away as I have never ridden in a car with the steering wheel on that side before. I was expecting that we would be traveling on the left side of the road as well, but that proved to not be the case. After looking around at other cars, there were many with the opposite configuration, with the steering wheel on the left, like here in the States. The best I can figure, they just get whatever used car they can get, regardless of where it originated. Papa John’s car just happened to originate from a country where they drive on the left!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drive from the airport was an interesting one. The road itself was actually quite nice, and there were many street lights and the like. Papa John, who claims his English is not so good (it seemed pretty good to me), said that the Chinese were hired to build this and some other roads. The road had 3 lanes and was relatively clear of traffic, for awhile. Papa John threw in a CD, Merle Haggard. Papa John started singing along with “Okie from Muskogee” and asked me if people really didn’t smoke marijuana in Muskogee. I had to admit that I had no idea, that I had never been there… Papa John told me that he likes country music, and that he considered himself the world’s only Congolese Cowboy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At one point, things changed. The road was still pretty decent, but it got dark. I could just make out the outlines of many, many people lining the road. They were very close to the road, but there wasn’t much for light in the area, so I couldn’t really tell what they were doing. I asked Papa John what people did on a Sunday night in Kinshasa, and he said he didn’t know, maybe listening to some music, maybe out for a beer… At several points, people would just cross the street, despite the fact that there were now many cars traveling at somewhat fast speeds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The road also got busy! Not BUSY, busy, like I would experience later in the trip, but busy enough that there was a lot of horn usage, and a lot of weaving in and out of traffic. At one point, Papa John said that you don’t want to “bump” anybody out here. If you bump somebody, and you have a nice care like this (his car had 180,000 miles or kilometers on it), you will be killed. I was, at that point, very happy I had hired a guide and driver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we drove on, we eventually wound into an area that was less crowded and better lit. It was Gombe, the commercial area, and what is ultimately “downtown” for Kinshasa. There were some nice buildings there, but nothing like what you would expect for a city of 10 million people. Around 9:00 PM local time, we pulled onto a rough, dirt road, pulled up to a gate surrounded by 10 foot high fences with razor wire on the top (something you see EVERYWHERE in Kinshasa), and Papa John honked his horn, something I would get very used to over the course of the upcoming week. A man came down, peeked out of the gate, then opened it and admitted us to the Sunny Day Flat Hotel and Guest House.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After parking, a man walked us down to my room. I thanked Papa John, paid him for half of his week’s work, and he left, leaving me to myself. After 24+ hours of travel, I was physically and mentally exhausted. But I wanted to unpack, and I needed to take my malaria medication, which you’re supposed to take with food, so I decided to try out my kitchen facilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took out a pot, filled it with some water from the tap, hoping that the boil I was about to give it would kill off any parasites in it, and put it on the stove. My plan was to make some Raman Noodles, some of which Jenny had packed for the trip. While the water was getting up to a boil, I unpacked a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My room was pretty modern. It had a television, air conditioner, stove, refrigerator, full bathroom with shower and bidet, and a voltage regulator for when the power didn’t exactly run as advertised. This was a nice feature - I plugged my computer into this so I didn’t have to worry about power surges taking it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-m7knw6OwDl0/VOlgO7_LhmI/AAAAAAAAkTs/elP4D-qulus/s1600/IMG_1276.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-m7knw6OwDl0/VOlgO7_LhmI/AAAAAAAAkTs/elP4D-qulus/s1600/IMG_1276.JPG" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-J_coxu9XXeU/VOlgPVhS-rI/AAAAAAAAkTw/uzdGYWLztDA/s1600/IMG_1277.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-J_coxu9XXeU/VOlgPVhS-rI/AAAAAAAAkTw/uzdGYWLztDA/s1600/IMG_1277.JPG" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ojdfpa4Yqao/VOlgP21RliI/AAAAAAAAkT8/cF7X26aW25E/s1600/IMG_1278.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ojdfpa4Yqao/VOlgP21RliI/AAAAAAAAkT8/cF7X26aW25E/s1600/IMG_1278.JPG" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-if53MYsoA4M/VOlgQv_x-uI/AAAAAAAAkUA/keA2zP98-Uc/s1600/IMG_1279.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-if53MYsoA4M/VOlgQv_x-uI/AAAAAAAAkUA/keA2zP98-Uc/s1600/IMG_1279.JPG" height="320" width="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 20 minutes, my water had yet to boil. Being quite tired, I tried to debug the situation, but was failing. I tried to use different burners, I tried to use 1 instead of 6, thinking that the Chinese stove (an IceStream, ironically) might use the opposite indications. Meanwhile, the water wouldn’t boil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to just forget it and trust that it would eventually boil. Meanwhile I decided to wash myself. A full day of travel made me pretty nasty. For some reason I thought it would be a good idea to wash up in the bidet. I squatted over it, pants down, and tried to wash my nether parts in there. That didn’t work so well… I ultimately decided to just take a quick shower, which was a wise decision. The bidet went unused the remainder of the trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my shower, the water still refused to boil. I spastically grabbed at the pot and it spilled all over my hands and pants. Luckily it didn’t burn me badly - I could just imagine having to go to the emergency room on a Sunday night in Kinshasa!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I took out a different pot with a heavier bottom, and it proved to do the trick. I ate my Raman Noodles, took my pill, then fell quickly asleep around 10:30 local time…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things seemed to be going fine and I figured I would have a nice head start toward being adjusted to the +7 hour time difference. It wasn’t to be, though. After 4 hours of fitful sleep, I awoke underneath my mosquito net, sweating profusely. After an hour of tossing and turning, I realized that my air conditioner must not be working properly. I got up, tried turning it on using the remote control, got up on a chair and tried to fix it, but nothing seemed to work. Eventually I just gave up, threw off my covers and sweated it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must have eventually fallen asleep, because I woke up to my alarm at 7:00. Papa John was supposed to come at 9:00, but I figured I could afford another hour, so I sweated through another hour of sleep before finally waking to my newly set alarm. </content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/325449672839393916/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=325449672839393916' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/325449672839393916'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/325449672839393916'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2015/02/the-great-congolese-caper-day-2-kinshasa.html' title='The Great Congolese Caper - Day 2 - Kinshasa'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-m7knw6OwDl0/VOlgO7_LhmI/AAAAAAAAkTs/elP4D-qulus/s72-c/IMG_1276.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-7155722206810151381</id><published>2015-02-22T08:44:00.003-06:00</published><updated>2015-02-22T08:45:56.054-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mireille'/><title type='text'>The Great Congolese Caper - Day 2 - In the Air</title><content type='html'>&lt;b&gt;Seat 33G to Kinshasa&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm Tired!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite there only being like 50 people in the gate area, this flight is completely full! I'm on the aisle in the middle section among the cattle again. The seat's not bad, though there's little leg room due to a heater or some box that is in my leg area.

For my first trip to France, it was a little underwhelming. I suppose it’s true what they say that you don’t really visit a country when you visit the airport…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After disembarking my flight, I followed the hallways and signage to where my next flight was taking off, Terminal 2E the K gates (I think). I bought the AT&amp;amp;T Passport plan before taking off, which allows for free text messaging and reduced call rates via cell phone, so I attempted to text Jenny to let her know that I landed. While my texts successfully went through eventually, Jenny was unable to text me back due to some complications with switching between iMessage and SMS texting. This is something I need to take up with Apple at some point, because it took us four days to finally figure it out. For those that might suffer the same issue, you have to turn off iMessage on your sending phone, then remove any text conversations that are on the phone, then send a new text message to the phone number and not the e-mail address… What a pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A quick train ride, which was packed, and I was at the next terminal where I finally encountered a security line. I was actually a little surprised at how little security was apparent until this point. I was freely moving about the airport despite having just arrived from the US. For all they know, I could have been infected with the measles!!! Anyway, French security was actually very courteous. I didn’t even have to take off my shoes. I was stopped and searched, however, because I had two bottles of water in my backpack. Stupid me, I didn’t figure I would have any water once I got to the hotel room in Kinshasa, and wanted to make sure I had enough to get me through to the morning when my guide would take me shopping. Despite the fact that you can keep your shoes on through security, they still don’t allow liquids through the checkpoint, and I had to relinquish my $10 worth of water purchased in Milwaukee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After getting back together, I stopped by a French sundries shop to get a new water (for $6) to satisfy my worries about the upcoming 24 hours or so. It was interesting that, while everything was clearly primarily in French, it seemed that everybody spoke some amount of English, which was good because my French is atrocious (read, non-existent). In line I encountered a couple of very tall, beautiful girls that were very upset at how the French don’t have proper jam…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally at my gate about 90 minutes early, I took off my shoes and relaxed a bit. As expected, I was one of the only white faces in the crowd. Of all of the people there, I was also clearly the most poorly dressed. I don’t know what sort of business people do, but it seems clear that there are many business people that travel between Paris and Kinshasa, many of which wear full suits, or at least proper business attire - even on a Sunday morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-a8x172OYhoA/VOlgNKkOcLI/AAAAAAAAkTY/RDcvZ_fnUSw/s1600/IMG_1274.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-a8x172OYhoA/VOlgNKkOcLI/AAAAAAAAkTY/RDcvZ_fnUSw/s1600/IMG_1274.JPG" height="320" width="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/2060035401982891321/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=2060035401982891321' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/2060035401982891321'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/2060035401982891321'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2015/02/the-great-congolese-caper-day-2-paris.html' title='The Great Congolese Caper - Day 2 - Paris, France'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-a8x172OYhoA/VOlgNKkOcLI/AAAAAAAAkTY/RDcvZ_fnUSw/s72-c/IMG_1274.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-7812701231599488474</id><published>2015-02-22T08:44:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2015-02-22T08:45:56.059-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mireille'/><title type='text'>The Great Congolese Caper - Day 1 - In the Air</title><content type='html'>&lt;b&gt;Seat 9a to MSP&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leg one is done. Yes, the easiest leg, but significant nonetheless. My seat wasn't bad - I was on the window next to an older woman who didn't take up too much room, so that was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I learned from this step of the journey:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;My earbuds suck. So much so that I have already replaced them with some cheap on ear headphones so I don't have to monkey with them the whole time on the next two flights.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm too obsessed with food. Not knowing what the status of food on the upcoming flight is, I gorged myself at Charly's Philly-style subs. Delicious, but didn't need all that food! I think I'm afraid of starving in the next week and feel like I can stave it off by eating way too much before I go!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Now I'm sitting at gate G9 waiting for my next leg to board. Interesting room of people. Some people are clearly foreign, but it's not super easy to determine. Going to be an interesting flight, but probably not quite as interesting as the next one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Seat 33a to Paris CDG&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my first trip overseas, I'm blessed to be on an Airbus A300-330 (or something like that), a big plane. It's a Delta flight, and this one looks to be newly decked out. The first class (or business class I suppose) cabin looks unbelievable. They don't really have seats more than they have cubicles, with LED screen televisions in each of them. Looks nice! Now to head to my seat - to the right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I'm with the cattle in the back of the plane. The seats are pretty much the same as any domestic coach class seat - not much room, very little ability to recline. At least the guy I was sitting next to doesn't smell or take up too much room. It does have two really nice features, though. First, it has a USB port that you can use to charge your electronics. Sadly it doesn't carry enough power to charge the iPad, but it sufficiently works with my iPhone. Secondly, it doesn't matter if it doesn't charge the iPad, because I don't even need to take it out. They have little LED widescreens on the back of each seat where you can choose from around 50 or more recent movies, most of which I haven't yet seen. So for the flight I took in three movies, “This is Where I Leave You,” “Whiplash,” and “Fury,” all three pretty good movies, and ones I normally wouldn't watch (or get to watch).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rJbdi04mkqw/VOlgLtP8LII/AAAAAAAAkTI/ewddiZcK4dE/s1600/IMG_1272.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rJbdi04mkqw/VOlgLtP8LII/AAAAAAAAkTI/ewddiZcK4dE/s1600/IMG_1272.JPG" height="240" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-k54qi7eWwrc/VOlgMQ1yWGI/AAAAAAAAkTQ/xp6yZHX9o2Q/s1600/IMG_1273.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-k54qi7eWwrc/VOlgMQ1yWGI/AAAAAAAAkTQ/xp6yZHX9o2Q/s1600/IMG_1273.JPG" height="320" width="240" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some other nice perks of this flight, all the drinks are free! Would that I only took advantage of that perk. I was so determined not to have to get up and go to the bathroom much that I pretty much went into hibernation mode. I did have to get up once during the flight, but timed it such that my seatmate was already gone, so I didn't have to bother him a single time. But hey, free beer! Also there was a meal on the flight, which would have been amazing had I known that. I gorged myself at the MSP airport thinking there may not be a meal. It wasn't a bad meal - I of course ate everything, including the “snack” they served as we approached CDG airport, a warm baguette with eggs and sausage on it. That was delicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we took off from MSP, it was fun looking at all of the lakes with ice rinks carved out of them. Actually it was fun that I recognized them, I suppose. Another cool part of this trip, I actually got to see the sunset near MSP and the sunrise near Paris, all within an 8 hour flight! Technology is cool!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While not watching movies with my new, inexpensive headphones, I watched the map application that showed flight statistics and our position in the world. As we flew over Ireland I saw many tiny little towns with what seemed only a handful of lights. As the sun came up we flew south of London, which is as close as I've ever gotten to London! It was also interesting to note the air temperature outside the plane as we flew - it consistently read -100 degrees F. for the entirety of the trip until we landed.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/7812701231599488474/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=7812701231599488474' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/7812701231599488474'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/7812701231599488474'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2015/02/the-great-congolese-caper-day-1-in-air.html' title='The Great Congolese Caper - Day 1 - In the Air'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rJbdi04mkqw/VOlgLtP8LII/AAAAAAAAkTI/ewddiZcK4dE/s72-c/IMG_1272.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-138851761473767171</id><published>2015-02-22T08:33:00.002-06:00</published><updated>2015-02-22T08:45:56.043-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mireille'/><title type='text'>The Great Congolese Caper - Day 1 - Milwaukee</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style="border: 0px; color: #333333; font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 18px; margin-top: 12px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;Saturday, 7-Feb-2015, Milwaukee, WI, USA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="border: 0px; color: #333333; font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 18px; margin-top: 12px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;So it begins… The trip I've been both dreading and anticipating has finally started.

Mireille is her name, and she is 2 and a half years old. She's been our daughter by Congolese law for over 6 months, but politics and what appears to be corruption have prevented us from bringing her home to live with us in the U.S. One day, I'm sure that will happen, though that day is not today, nor is it this week.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="border: 0px; color: #333333; font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 18px; margin-top: 12px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;There are options… Options I have to consider as a parent, but that I don't want to consider as a human being.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="border: 0px; color: #333333; font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 18px; margin-top: 12px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;These entries aren't really about that, however, though I'm sure my thoughts will drag me that way from time to time.

I've never flown this far before - I've never even been off the North American continent before! I don't speak French, or Lingala, the local dialects spoken in Kinshasa. I'm white, and will be dwelling in a sea of black faces. I'm American, with all the joy and perception that carries with it overseas! I have hired a driver and guide to accompany me from the airport and when I'm going around the city, but I don't have a good feeling that he is on the same page as me - I'm worried he won't be at the airport when I get there!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="border: 0px; color: #333333; font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 18px; margin-top: 12px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;But mostly I'm worried about spending a week with my 2 year old daughter whom I've never met. Will she like me? Will she freak out? What does she eat? What if she gets sick? What is going through her head? How scary must this all be for her?!!?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="border: 0px; color: #333333; font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 18px; margin-top: 12px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: inherit;"&gt;These are all things I think as I sit here, in my home town terminal, waiting for the first short leg of my journey.

They aren't particularly interesting sometimes, but since this blog represents my kids' baby book to some degree, it needs to be here for recording purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;All In a Day's Work&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div&gt;Quin is a big kid, the biggest in his class by several inches (more than that among the boys). It's probably not all that impressive considering that there are only 4 boys in his class and 8 kids overall, but it's still worth noting. During the first couple weeks of school we always have to work with him on transitioning from the anarchy of summer back into the more orderly, creativity killing environment that is school, and it can be a hard transition. Many notes and "red marks" during those first few weeks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;One day we were particularly pleased to find a note sent home from one of the other teachers in the school who had gone out of their way to compliment Quinton on having helped out a smaller kid when he was having trouble opening the bathroom door. Apparently Quinton opened and held the door for him, and the teacher who witnessed this was impressed enough that they penned a little note. Jenny gave him an appropriate amount of praise to help encourage that behavior in the future, to which he responded, "All in a day's work, mom."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Breakfast&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div&gt;Jenny's on a food kick. I wouldn't necessarily call it a health food kick, nor would I call it anti-sugar, but she's definitely paying more attention to the ingredients on packaged goods to the point where cereal has moved considerably down on our list of proper breakfast options. Instead we will either make a huge batch of pancakes at the beginning of the week, make eggs, yogurt (the low sugar variety), or french toast. French toast is one we don't typically do either due to the complexity in preparing it and its inability to be frozen and still taste good on reheating (a la pancakes). When we do have it, though, it is a favorite. For some reason, though, Quin couldn't remember what it was called. For the longest time he called it "Canadian Toast." In fact, he was so enamored with Canada for the longest time that he was referring to himself as a African Canadian instead of an African American. That played out further to him eventually calling it "African American Toast." We knew what he meant... I'm not sure what he'll call it next time.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/2182799275078716351/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=2182799275078716351' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/2182799275078716351'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/2182799275078716351'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2014/10/quin-quickies.html' title='Quin Quickies'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-6766351738902052208</id><published>2014-10-17T15:23:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2014-10-17T15:23:00.474-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Mireille'/><title type='text'>Mireille</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt; I'm outing us to the world. Well, Jenny outed us on Facebook about a month ago, but this post makes it official - we are in the process of adopting a little girl from the Democratic Republic of Congo. In fact, we've been matched with our daughter for 18 months, and are in fact her legal parents by that country's laws. In a very strange combination of power plays and international politics, however, we are unable to bring her home to the United States. What's worse, we still have no idea when it might be that we will be able to bring her home. That aside, she is already starting to provide for some fun stories, which I always like to share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On September 9, Mireille (that's her name) turned 2. 4 months prior to that she was relocated to a foster home in the capital city of Kinshasa in the western region of the DRC. On various occasions we tried to send things over to her; shoes, dresses, toys, but the shipping to the DRC is prohibitively expensive. I tried to send a small package, about 12 inches square on the top and 5 inches deep, it weighed no more than 8 pounds. Fedex was willing to ship it for $250. To get around that, we rely on people who are visiting the country to mule trinkets over there for her, which happens from time to time. For her birthday, however, we wanted to send her a present that actually got to her on the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jenny played with the idea of just biting the bullet and sending something. We also looked into the possibility of there being an internet commerce site that had local shipping in Africa, but alas, we found none. We finally came up with the idea of just wiring money over and having our lawyer or one of his assistants help us out and get her a gift locally. So that's what we did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, one would think that, of all the places in the world, you would be able to find a black doll in the center of the continent of Africa. Well, apparently not. What our lawyer managed to find was perhaps the creepiest, whitest doll that I could imagine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="text-align: center; clear: both;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Ah10Aev1wbQ/VEF6jj-VPcI/AAAAAAAAieM/pkRgG59kEe0/s640/Photo%25252020141017152236.jpg" target="_blank" style=""&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Ah10Aev1wbQ/VEF6jj-VPcI/AAAAAAAAieM/pkRgG59kEe0/s500/Photo%25252020141017152236.jpg" id="blogsy-1413577384337.0083" class="alignnone" alt="" width="480" height="640"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's good to find out that our daughter has some taste, however, as she clearly wants nothing to do with this doll. In fact, the whole series of pictures says to me that she'd rather mess around on her phone than have anything to do with that doll!

But if he finds a toad in the yard, or a stray bug on a window, he gets his ice cream pale, fills it with a little water and some leaves, and puts the poor thing in there until we force him to release the poor animal before they become a dead animal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mice!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every autumn we get an influx of visitors. These are the types of visitors that we don't really welcome. We knew they were around one night a couple of weeks ago when Jenny woke up in the middle of the night to hear scratching on the insides of the walls. Mice...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I did what I typically do - I set old fashioned, cheap, spring loaded, wooden traps. Baited with peanut butter, I've never had a problem eradicating the population in the past. And indeed it appeared it was going to work again. On the first two nights I was able to eliminate two of our guests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third night, however, I placed traps in the usual high traffic locales. When I checked them in the morning, the traps were still set, but there was no peanut butter on the tripping mechanism. So I reset the traps, and again in the morning, no bait. These were some talented mice... Deciding that I was going to have to bring out the big guns, I set another trap next to the existing traps, thinking that the mouse might accidentally step on one of the traps tripping mechanism in order to get to the bait on the other. Apparently they were too smart for that as well!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the boys and I went to the hardware store to procure some glue traps. I'm not a fan of them, but we'll get to that in a minute. My thought process was to put the glue traps out next to the two unsprung traps without bait and wait for the mayhem to ensue. Imagine my luck, the very next day we had netted two new guests, one on one of the wooden spring traps - he was dead, and another in the glue trap - he was alive. Crap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, I am a man, of course, but when I deal with mice, it takes every ounce of energy I have to muster up the courage to address what I know has to be done. I like the wooden traps as it kills the mice for me and I can just put a plastic bag around it to transport it outside - no rodent/human contact required. The glue traps, however, simply trap the mice so they can't get away. You have to wait for nature to starve them out or you need to address it yourself...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, Quin and I discovered the mice the next day. I actually only saw one, and Quin went directly in to check it out. It was he who discovered that we had trapped another one in the mayhem device as I had hoped. When he saw the one mouse looking at us, alive in the glue trap, he immediately went and got his ice cream bucket. I explained to him that we weren't going to keep the mouse, but we had to take care of them and get them out of the house, so I got a plastic bag and started walking toward the mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I walked toward it, the live mouse started FREAKING OUT, looking like he might even be able to escape the glue trap without some of his limbs and skin, and crawl away to die and rot somewhere in the house. Knowing that wasn't a good option, and not wanting to get bit, I knew what I had to do, but I also knew that I needed to get Quin out of there. Trying to be as calm as I could be, I asked him to leave. I wasn't very savvy, however, because even though he left, he immediately started sobbing uncontrollably. I took care of the situation, reluctantly and with as much dignity as I could muster, then got our guests out of the house as quickly as I could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I found Quin outside, tears were rolling down his face. "Is he dead?" he asked me. I said he was. I tried to smooth it over telling him that mice outside are great, but mice inside are dangerous to us. He seemed to accept that, even stating that "Heinzy might eat one and get sick, right?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, I'm still a little creeped out by having to whack the mouse over the head to put him out of his misery. But it makes me happy that Quin was upset by it. It means he has some grasp of the finality of death, and that he is likely not a sociopath or a psychopath, which I find endearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right; font-size: small; clear: both;" id="blogsy_footer"&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogsyapp.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogsyapp.com/images/blogsy_footer_icon.png" alt="Posted with Blogsy" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 5px;" width="20" height="20" /&gt;Posted with Blogsy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/7746871867281755291/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=7746871867281755291' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/7746871867281755291'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/7746871867281755291'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2014/10/the-great-mouse-caper.html' title='The Great Mouse Caper'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-4465041949344836836</id><published>2014-09-08T11:22:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2014-09-08T11:22:09.031-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='TMI'/><title type='text'>Quin Quickies</title><content type='html'>&lt;h1&gt;The Circumcision&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This weekend, my brother-in-law turned 50 and we were invited to his party. On the 30 minute drive to his house, Jenny and I were behaving like the good parents that we are and allowing the kids to listen to the Comedy Central channel on Sirius Satellite Radio, something of which we are currently enjoying a free trial. The content on the station isn't all that, well, appropriate, but we count on the kids not listening much like they don't listen to us - ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At one point during the programming, they broke away from the usual stand-up commedian routine and inserted a funny song. This particular song was a parody to Queen's "Fat Bottomed Girls." It was titled "God Hates the Tips of Little Baby's Dicks," a song about circumcision, obviously. Of course, Quinton and Ethan were listening, and Quin reacted to the rest of our cackles at the lyrics of this very funny song. Ethan was a little embarrased, but Jenny asked him if he remembered when Quinton was circumsized, something we were unfortunate enough to walk in on during the early days of his life - something that Ethan wasn't on board with at the time to be sure! Quinton heard this conversation and asked what we were talking about and we told him we were talking about when he got circumcized as a baby. He asked, somewhat aptly, "I got Super Sized?" I'm sure there's a racial stereotype that makes that funny, but I probably shouldn't write about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Poop&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being that I have the sense of humor and maturity level of your average 6 year old, there are few things in the world that I find more hilarious than jokes and stories about pooping or farting. This story changed that a little for me, and I died a little bit inside when I realized it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jenny was away on business as she does maybe once or twice a year, leaving the boys and I to fend for ourselves for a few days. It was mid-June and we were trying to get some landscaping and yard work done before we were hosting a party later in the summer, so I elected to take the day off on this particular Thursday to get some things done before needing to deal with the kids' schedules. This was the day that Jenny was schedule to be home, so we were all excited and relieved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beginning of the day was easy enough - rides to summer school with lunches in tow, pick Ethan up around noon, then go get Quin at 4:00, get him changed, fed, and ready for baseball at 6:30. After picking Quin up, I quickly fed him and sat him in front of the television to unwind from the day by 5:15. I figured I had just enough time to complete digging the 14 inch deep hole I had been excavating in the back yard where our patio would eventually live. I figured I needed to be in the house by 5:50 in order to get Quin changed and ready in time to get to baseball by 6:20 or so. By the time I finished digging the hole it was 5:40 - I was 10 minutes early! What on earth would I do with all of this extra time? I was about to find out...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I went inside to clean up and asked Quin to go upstairs and change into his baseball uniform which I had laid out earlier that day. He immediately complied, which should have had me wondering, but I was already riding the high of having extra time that I didn't think anything of it. After washing up and changing my clothes, I went upstairs to see how Quin was doing getting into his uniform. I found him naked in the bathroom where he handed me his underwear and said, "here dad, you better take care of this." The underwear were completely covered in crap. It was so much that my brain couldn't really process it adequately, but what I figured was that he went to the bathroom at school and forgot to wipe, something he's famous for doing. So I asked him, "did you forget to wipe at school today?" "Yes," he said plainly. OK, no problem, I sent him into his room to get dressed and I took the underwear to the toilet as my mother had taught me to do when we were dealing with the cloth diapers of my younger siblings and I rinsed them out and left them to dry in the bathtub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After having dealt with that, I went into Quin's room, and he was standing behind his bed, something he typically doesn't do. That got me to wondering, but still didn't think much of it. "What are you doing back there?" I asked him. "Getting dressed," he told me. That was when I observed the state of the room and found the brown colored footprints leading all the way through his room, around the bed to where he was sitting. Finally aware of the full breadth of the situation, I asked him to walk around the bed where I noticed that his entire leg and backside were covered in human fecal material. Well, I guess I knew what I was going to do with my "extra" 10 minutes!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Aw man, did you have an accident?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Are you feeling sick? Did you have diarrhea?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What's diarrhea?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When your poop is all runny."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No, it was a big log!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, it didn't turn out to be too big a deal. I cleaned the footprints to eliminate the evidence and we found a pair of black sweatpants to replace the ruined white baseball pants that he was intending to wear, and we still made it to baseball on time...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was REALLY happy for Jenny to come home that night!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right; font-size: small; clear: both;" id="blogsy_footer"&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogsyapp.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogsyapp.com/images/blogsy_footer_icon.png" alt="Posted with Blogsy" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 5px;" width="20" height="20" /&gt;Posted with Blogsy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/4465041949344836836/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=4465041949344836836' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/4465041949344836836'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/4465041949344836836'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2014/09/quin-quickies.html' title='Quin Quickies'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-868581295958915246</id><published>2014-07-23T10:39:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2014-07-23T10:39:57.957-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Older Kids...</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt; It's been awhile since I've written anything about Ethan. He's getting older, as you might guess. It's actually been quite shocking of late. In a year's time he passed his mother up in height and weight and his voice has reached a near approximation of a man's voice - a small man maybe, but a man's voice nonetheless. His shoulders and arms bear resemblance to the Tibbett side I can only assume since they have grown muscular despite him not really doing much in the line of working them out, and he can grow a fair mustache. Sure it's a little thin, but it's facial hair. Not sure how I feel about our baby getting so big so quickly - he promises to pass me up in the next couple of years. I keep joking that I need to find ways to scare him in case he one day realizes that he could take me in a dual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's also been nice to have a "built-in babysitter." It sure would have been helpful 3 years ago as our prospects for getting out of the house were much more frequent in their calling in those days, but it is really nice to know that he is a fairly mature, reasonable, and responsible person with whom we can leave Quinton and the dog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's not to say he doesn't sometime lack good judgment. A couple of weeks ago, just prior to our summer party, I introduced Ethan to Zombieland, a rated-R movie (yes, judge me all you want, but Ethan watches rated-R movies). I suppose it is one thing for me to let him watch it, but he thought it a good idea to watch it with his little brother. I didn't know this was going on until Quin came downstairs and informed me that he now knew a new naughty word. Knowing his version of what naughty words are, I figured he meant something like "hate" or "stupid," so I asked him what his new word was and he responded, "f*cking @ss." There's something hilarious about hearing those words coming out of Quinton's mouth, but knowing it wouldn't be wise to encourage him, I managed to stay straight faced and told him that it indeed was a naughty word and that he should never use it in front of his grandmother...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right; font-size: small; clear: both;" id="blogsy_footer"&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogsyapp.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogsyapp.com/images/blogsy_footer_icon.png" alt="Posted with Blogsy" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 5px;" width="20" height="20" /&gt;Posted with Blogsy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/868581295958915246/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=868581295958915246' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/868581295958915246'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/868581295958915246'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2014/07/older-kids.html' title='Older Kids...'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-7699629533312535567</id><published>2014-07-23T10:37:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2014-07-23T10:37:28.227-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><title type='text'>Big, Fat, and Stupid</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt; A couple of weeks ago I got an e-mail from an old co-worker who still worked at my old place of employment. It was a complimentary e-mail, fairly light in nature, which made it all the more mysterious why the e-mail header on my iPad read, "To: Big, Fat, and Stupid - From: &amp;lt;name omitted&amp;gt;". Hmm... I asked him why that was what he had called me in his address book and he claimed innocense. I figured somebody at my old job was probably playing a funny joke by getting one of the IT guys to mess with my name on the company mail server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn't think much more about it for a couple of weeks until I found myself in the car with the whole family in tow. We were contemplating going to a movie, but didn't know what was playing. Since I was driving, I enabled my iPhone's digital assistant, Siri, and asked what movies were playing. As happens from time to time, the voice recognition didn't work so well and Siri responded to me, "I'm sorry, Big, Fat, and Stupid, I don't know how to do that." The car erupted in a fit of laughter and things started to come into focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago when I first got this version of the iPhone, I remember showing the kids the Siri feature and how you could get her to call you different names just by talking to her. To demonstrate I said to her, "Call me Big Sexy." After that, I left it like that. There seemed no reason to change it, afterall. Over time, Apple rolled the nickname feature out to other apps, including Mail. So that explained why my coworker's e-mail was addressed to "Big, Fat, and Stupid." What it didn't explain was who perpetrated such a heinous joke on my person!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I addressed the car, all of whom were still laughing. I first looked at Ethan who said, "That's hilarious, and I wish I had done it, but I didn't..." I then turned to Jenny who simply stated, "You know I didn't do it - I don't even know how to do that!" Which left me with the only person I knew who had the gumption, know-how, and inventiveness to commit this crime. He was smiling to himself with his eyes focused intently on his iPod screen, playing a game. I asked him and he fessed up. Still not wanting to believe he did it, I asked him how he managed to do the deed. He calmly explained, "you were in the shower, and your iPhone was in the office. So I went in there and said to Siri, Siri, call me Big, Fat, and Stupid, but I said it soft so you wouldn't hear me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To me the most impressive part of this joke is also the most frightening. Quin clearly did this several weeks prior. He somehow, as a six year old, managed to resist the urge to force me into immediate discovery, instead opting for the far more potentially devastating punchline of me discovering it on my own at a later time, wondering what had really happened...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right; font-size: small; clear: both;" id="blogsy_footer"&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogsyapp.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogsyapp.com/images/blogsy_footer_icon.png" alt="Posted with Blogsy" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 5px;" width="20" height="20" /&gt;Posted with Blogsy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/7699629533312535567/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=7699629533312535567' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/7699629533312535567'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/7699629533312535567'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2014/07/big-fat-and-stupid.html' title='Big, Fat, and Stupid'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-8282628653592473149</id><published>2014-07-09T21:29:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2014-07-09T21:29:21.509-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Summer Vacation 2014 - Day 5 - Saturday</title><content type='html'>That's right, we're going a little Tarantino here with the time jumping and what-not. By now it's been nearly two weeks and the scars are just starting to form. This will be a blissfully short retrospective on the fifth day of our summer vacation, lest it is lost for all time to the memory of the harrowing experience of the trip home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday was not at all unlike Friday in most regards. A quick breakfast at the hotel, stop at Starbucks, then off to Regis University for our second and final full day of camp activities. The format was much the same as the previous day - we dropped the kids off into their age banded groups then headed off to our adult talks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning were a number of panels, which were quite informational. The first one was staffed by three adult trans-racial adoptees, one of which has gained quite a bit of notoriety in the area through the documentary her husband made of her and her search for her birth family. If you ever are. interested, Closure is a wonderfully filmed story of Angela's story, growing up as a black child in a white family, and her curiosity and ultimate search for her birth parents. Check it out at&amp;nbsp;http://closuredocumentary.com. There were also two others on the panel, both college students. All three were very thoughtful and provided the attendees with a lot of insight into what types of things our kids might be thinking. Man - being a parent is hard...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that we sat through a forum with several local members in the black community, one of which was the great grandson of W.E.B. Dubois. These folks, though none had great insight or experience in the adoption community, all had first class insight into what it was like living in America as a black adult. So many fun stories, like the myriad times they've been pulled over by the police, or had things thrown at them while walking down the street... In the end, they had very positive messages and it was good to hear their perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lunch today was Haitian, which I think included chicken... It was hard to tell. Mainly lunch was for Quin to get together with a bunch of other kids and play soccer...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After lunch Jenny and I split into groups and followed separate tracks. I got a lesson in Hip Hop culture and how it affects the teenage mind, while Jenny learned about trauma and the adopted child. I then sat in on a history of Ethiopia while Jenny went to a session called Hart talks (or something to that effect). The history of Ethiopia was really fascinating, actually. I didn't realize what a big role it has played in a lot of other world histories, particularly religion. Apparently if it weren't for Ethiopia, the Muslim religion may have ceased to exist when they were ousted from Saudi Arabia. It was and is also a Christian stronghold, center of the Ethiopian Orthodox sect of Christianity. They even claim to have the Arc of the Covenant hidden away somewhere in the country, which after I heard it, I remembered reading something about that on CNN at one point. Probably the most interesting thing I learned was about Ras Tafari, a long time Ethiopian "emperor" who had many progressive views on African freedom and their place in the world, and who the Rastafarian religion of Jamaica is centered around. Fascinating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After class, we picked up the kids and went to Golden for an evening at the water park. After getting a quick dinner at a local pizza joint, we congregated at Splash where the entire park was reserved for our group. The park was pretty small, but had all the highlights that you require from a water park - a couple of slides, a big bucket that fills with water and dumps on the kids, and a diving board. Ethan had a great time with his new friend Luke, and Quin had fun floating through the water and occasionally paying attention to the girl that claimed him as her boyfriend - perhaps the cutest 5 year old girl I've ever met... We may need to move to Colorado just so Quin has a chance at being friends with this girl!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a long day, so after almost 3 hours at the water park we eagerly drove back to our hotel and went immediately to bed. With the thought of the long trip ahead of us the next day, sleep took us (well, me for sure) quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we didn't attend camp on Sunday, a couple of parting thoughts about the camp, in no particular order:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jenny likes to point out that we are nowhere near the oldest people, or even among the norm of the aged among adoptive families. I'm not sure how I feel about that, but it makes her happy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's always good to go to these things to remind us how to be a little more understanding as parents and people. I swear, for several days after this camp we were much better parents. We've reverted back to our nasty selves now, but it made a big difference for a couple of days. I'm sure they taught the kids to be better kids during their sessions, too.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Denver is a beautiful place with a seemingly vibrant African American community, though the statistics tell a different story. I imagine our perspective was skewed since we were at an African/Caribbean Heritage camp!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We met some very interesting people, and hooked up with one guy (one of the counselors) that was from DR Congo. In fact, we've been in contact with him already several times since camp and he promises to help us out should we ever make the journey to Kinshasa to pickup Mireille.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/8282628653592473149/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=8282628653592473149' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/8282628653592473149'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/8282628653592473149'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2014/07/summer-vacation-2014-day-5-saturday.html' title='Summer Vacation 2014 - Day 5 - Saturday'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-6243840306621851404</id><published>2014-06-30T23:04:00.003-05:00</published><updated>2014-06-30T23:04:46.368-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Summer Vacation 2014 - There and Back Again</title><content type='html'>&lt;b&gt;Introduction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9:30 on Monday, June 30, 2014. We're all showered, Quin is in bed, Jenny's powering through another bout with Facebook, I'm watching The Wolverine with Ethan... It's easy to forget about the events of the last 36 hours. It's taken me an hour to type up the summary on this page, so I can only imagine how long the actual account will take me. This will be an epic, to be sure. It will only cover about 36 hours of actual time, but I fear it may take me almost that much time to condense my thoughts into the written word. I can promise you intrigue, adventure, horror, romance - well, maybe not romance, but it is quite a story. It will be long. I feel like Tolkien sitting down and recounting Bilbo's trip back to The Shire. This could take a while, but hopefully it will not bore too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those astute readers (dear reader - sorry, I've been listening to a lot of Steven King on the trip), you will have by now recognized that there is a gap in the retelling of our vacation. I found the first two entries of this year's trip to be limp and boring. I feel like today's offering has the right components of a good story, and as such, I wanted to ensure I put it to paper as soon as I could so I didn't forget what I wanted to represent here. I promise I will circle back and summarize the last day of camp for those that are keeping track and are interested. Consider this entry a more secular version of our vacation. OK, I'm going to start now, I promise. You might want to get new reading glasses and freshen up your drink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sunday Morning&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;It's Sunday morning. We have developed a bad habit of sleeping through the alarm and sleeping a full 9 hours on most of our vacations rather than doing the right thing and getting a run in at altitude. We finally come to around 8:00 AM Mountain Time to get our day started. The camp is not yet ended - there are the closing ceremonies and clean-up yet to occur. We've decided to forego these ceremonies and instead get a head start on our 15 hour drive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the kids were finally up and showered, we finally took off by 9:00 and headed down to Denver proper to say goodbye to Maylee and Steve, our hosts from a few nights prior. After a quick breakfast at Einstein's Bagels, Jenny, Maylee, and Ethan went to Albertsons to procure snacks for our drive while Steve, Quinton, and I went to Lowry Liquors to fill the spot emptied in the car from the donation we made to the camp for the silent auction. Quinton was a big help. Walking into the store, he immediately went to get a cart. I want to think it is because he likes to push carts, but I think it's because he knows that I typically&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;need&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;a cart when I shop in a liquor store. Colorado has a wonderful selection of beer, many of which I can get in Wisconsin, but many I cannot. For those in the beer nerd crowd, Colorado has moved past the IPA craze and is now brewing and enjoying beers across many different styles! I intended to get 4-six packs, but ended up with 5 and a four pack to boot. Quinton was right. He pushed the cart along with Steve and I while I traded and re-traded selections several times and to the front of the store once I ultimately settled on my final selections. Once at the checkout, the proprietor packed my selections into a box that Quin offered to carry. The proprietor said he could not take that, but asked me if it was OK if Quin had a lollypop instead. Once I said yes, he set an entire bucket of lollypops in front of Quin and said, "here you go," surely expecting Quin to take one and move along. Quin, somewhat predictably, instead grabbed the entire bucket and started to walk out. He confidently smiled at the owner and thanked him before Steve and I convinced him that he only really needed one...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To go a little Tarantino for a second, Quin's behavior and confidence at the liquor store reminded me of something I've been noticing in Ethan of late. It's happened on several occasions lately, but it was quite pronounced on this vacation. There were several occasions where Ethan was hanging around with Jenny and I while we were talking with new people that we had just met. They were addressing Ethan directly, asking him questions, as is polite to do, though teenagers seem to dread it and often shy away from that sort of contact. Lately, however, Ethan has been showing a lot of confidence in these dealings, looking people directly in the eye, smiling confidently, and actually maintaining a solid, enthusiastic conversation with them. I've been very impressed by this of late. If I don't get to the topic in tomorrow's post about the last day of camp, Ethan was also very impressive in this camp by his ability to hook up with and meet new friends. He made a couple of solid acquaintances on this trip that I'm sure he will maintain contact with either through his various social networks or through Xbox live. Isn't the future great!??! OK, enough of the distraction...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By 10:30 Mountain, the closing ceremonies were most likely in full swing, but we were on the road, on our way through Eastern Colorado toward our home in Wisconsin, which we hoped to reach sometime early on the subsequent morning. Eastern Colorado, or the Colorado Desert is, in a word, boring. If it wasn't for the mountains, Colorado would be a painfully boring place. Good thing they have the mountains, I suppose! We powered through the 2 hours of 76 in short order, stopping at the end for subs and gasoline. Quin was pretty cranky by this point - having been off his schedule for almost an entire week by this point, but we ate our lunch and powered on through Nebraska - wonderful Nebraska!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day portion of the trip went on without a hitch. Quin napped a considerable amount, which boded well for his mood later in the day. Nebraska during the day looks much like Nebraska during the night. In fact, there's little to distinguish between the two. It's LONG! Along the way we stopped at Hastings at perhaps the most glorious truck stop I have ever encountered. They had a couple of food places, an arcade with a full size replica of Predator, foot-long roller dogs, and actual ice cream shakes which were pretty good! They were even building a Quaker Steak and Lube there, which should be opening sometime this fall. I may actually want to go back there sometime!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We spent 6 solid hours in Nebraska before we finally got to Omaha, which marked the finish of the first half of our journey. Along the way I encountered what may have been, in retrospect, my first omen of what was to come. I've had a problem with my van in the past where the condenser drain backed up and started emptying in the car cabin. Sometime in central Nebraska I started to feel a cool drip of water on my bare feet. I knew at once what it was, and it only got worse as the day waned and the A/C ran... My second omen was, again in retrospect, encountered while listening to a book on tape by Michael Crighton called Pirate Latitudes. It was one book that I hadn't yet read from Crighton, and it proved to be pretty good, though Jenny wasn't wild about it. The ending was pretty terrible in my opinion, however - I suspect that Crighton either lost interest or died before he finished the book, but they published it anyway... Anyway, at one point during the eastern part of Nebraska, the protagonists encountered the Kraken, a bad omen for their journey. I thought tacitly to myself that this could be an omen for myself as well as for the crew, but I did so jokingly...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, we passed through Omaha and stopped just across the Iowa border in Council Bluffs where we enjoyed dinner at Perkins, a perennial favorite (and also one of the only places open at 8:00 on a Sunday evening). There was a feeling of relief in the air. There was a definite anticipation for the trip to be over and for life to normalize again - most of all, everybody was looking forward to sleeping in our own beds in 7-8 short hours! Mother Nature, as it seems, had a different plan for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lightening scarred the sky while the crew of "El Trinidad" encountered the Kraken for the second time. Western Iowa was getting some weather, it was clear, though we didn't really see any significant rain. Des Moines proved to be quite the tease on this leg of the journey. The map said something like 125 miles, and we were averaging around 75 miles per hour, so we figured on getting there some time before 11:00 Central. Somehow, though, the miles kept lagging behind as though we were only averaging 60 miles per hour. Ultimately it took us 2 full hours to get there, though admittedly we did stop once to go to the rest room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we pass Des Moines, I begin to get hopeful that we might make it home by 4:00, thinking (wrongly) that we are only an hour from Cedar Rapids, then another 4 hours from home. Cedar Rapids, though, is nearly 2 hours from Des Moines... I was getting a little despondent as we stopped another time, this time to allow Jenny to get a towel to cover herself so I could continue to run the AC and to have its condensed water drip on my feet, keeping me alert and awake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Monday Morning&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hours passed slowly, the lightening continues uninterrupted. We pass the Highway 151 exit and I briefly consider taking it instead of taking the more traveled interstate toward Cedar Rapids, but I quickly dismiss it. I was tired, the gas tank was getting to the point where I needed to fill it again, but the family wanted to get home! At 12:30, we finally reached I380 and turn north. A short 12 mile jaunt north and we turn off onto Highway 151 to start the last quarter of our journey, the most difficult quarter behind us. I put off gassing up until I'm on the 151 bypass of Cedar Rapids, looking forward to taking on a Red Bull and a water and staying plenty alert for the last 1/4 of the journey. That proved to be a fantasy, however...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Splashdown&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I380 passes over Highway 151/30, so the exit winds down and to the east at a somewhat sharp curve. We took it at the suggested 30 MPH speed. By this point I am bleary eyed, but hopeful of making the next 10 miles go quickly so I can stop, gas up, and clear my head. As I round the curve toward 151 I notice that the road is covered in water. I didn't think much of it, but as I hit the water, it crashed violently over my windshield as the tires on our car stopped responding. I slammed on the brakes and the car stopped... We were obviously in deeper water than I had anticipated. The car was lilting toward the passenger side, where it came up above the floorboards. The driver's side wasn't quite as bad, perhaps only 12 inches deep there. There was mass hysteria. I calmed myself as quickly as I could and tried to calm Quin and Ethan (Jenny was going to have to fend for herself). I quickly got out of the car and coaxed the kids out as well. Quin wanted to make sure that his Furby was OK - we had won it in the silent auction at camp. Ethan yelled that the water was coming in the car! It took about 30 seconds for the reality of what had happened to sink in. We were stuck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole family got out but the water was rising somewhat (I may have imagined that). We moved to higher ground and assessed the situation. My next thought was for our stuff, particularly my electronics (stupid westerner!). I went quickly back to the car and checked the situation with our luggage and was satisfied that it was safe and dry for the moment. A moment later, a car came speeding down at us from 380 which was the first reminder that we were standing on a freeway in the middle of the night, and that was scary! He saw our flashers and stopped, luckily. He was from Wisconsin as well, and managed to not get his car stuck, but stopped and asked if he could help us (a trend we would see throughout the evening). I took him up on his offer and between he, Ethan, Jenny, and myself, we managed to push the car out of the 18 or so inches of water toward the high side of the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several other cars and semis came speeding around the curve. Many of them stopped and asked if we needed help. Not knowing what to do myself, we told them we were OK and they should continue on themselves. An eastern European couple came the closest to hitting us, and also had almost as bad a luck as we did. I tried briefly to converse with them as they stalled out about 50 feet in front of us, but quickly found it was pointless as they neither wanted nor were able to communicate effectively with me (nor I with them), so we left each other to our own devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a couple of occasions I tried to start the car. The power was still working, but when I tried to turn the ignition it behaved as though I needed a jump. I didn't know if it was going to dry out at some point and I would be able to move on, or if we were in real trouble. As Jenny and I were arguing over whether we should walk to a gas station or some other place (there were none around), Jenny dropped her phone in 6 inches of standing water... The dollar signs were starting to add up for me in my head and I got despondent for a brief moment. Getting over it, I decided that the modern day savior, the cell phone, was our best course of action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first called the police, thinking that they might want to get somebody there to warn people from running into the same ordeal we had run into. For the first time in my life, I dialed 911 confidently and was answered in 30 or so seconds by a clearly frazzled dispatcher. I tried calmly to tell her where I was and that there was a lot of standing water that was dangerous to the public there. Of course my situation was the most dire in the area at this time!!! She excitedly explained to me that there was major flooding all over Cedar Rapids, and to please hold. She moved away from the phone and was talking to somebody else in the room who was trying to get a boat to perform a rescue at the HyVee. At that point I realized that we were very small potatoes in the grand scheme of this storm. Like a good dispatcher she got back on the phone and asked me to continue to hold, trying to reassure me that I was important, but I convinced her that I could handle it myself and she should attend to the real emergencies - I think she was ultimately pleased. I'm probably on the NSA's radar now, though, having called 911 for real...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next attempt was to get a tow truck. I tried the first one that came up on Google only to be met with an answering machine. The second one got me to a dispatcher that informed me that the average wait time right now was 3-4 hours. Aw crap. I hung up and explained it to Jenny who was unimpressed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During this time, no fewer than 5 cars and many people on foot had stopped to inquire as to our wellbeing and to see if they could do anything. I'm very impressed with the people of Cedar Rapids, for the record! As I tried to come up with another idea, Jenny started talking to four guys in an extended cab pickup truck who said they had a tow-truck they could go get and help us out. She came over to me and told me to go talk with them. As I started to negotiate the deal, a truck from the company that I had called came rolling by and was apparently impressed enough by our situation that he stopped to help us - this was 10 minutes after we were told it would be 3-4 hours! Our luck was improving! To boot, Jenny's phone was still working - maybe this wouldn't be all bad!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Pat is assessing our situation, he is preparing us for the worst. I explain what is happening and he told us that we are likely looking at a new engine or new car entirely. First thing's first, though, he wants to get our car off of the freeway and get us somewhere we can stay the night. Since he had a long night in front of him, he squeezed us all into his cab and dropped us along with our car off at his parent company where they will hopefully be able to address our car in the morning. As we drove there, we had to drive through another section of 2 foot water before finally arriving at a desolate truck repair center near the ethanol plant in Cedar Rapids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pat convinced us that we should just call a cab and even wrote down the address for where they should pick us up. I agreed and he left to what was sure to be a long, long night for him - he had diverted from a call to get us to where we were at that point, which was better than drenched on the side of a soggy interstate! He even thought to call us back 10 minutes later to remind us to keep the keys in the car so the mechanics could assess the damage in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We called a cab, which showed up about 20 minutes later. I had found a hotel, which in my exhaustion I thought was the Comfort Inn, and asked him to take us there. He took us a very nearby cluster of hotels, but there was no Comfort Inn. For some reason it took about 3 minutes to figure out that any hotel will do, just drop us off at one!!! I said if they didn't have rooms we could just walk to another one. The cabbie would have nothing of it, however, as we were in a "bad part of town" and we "shouldn't be walking around there." He meant well, and we appreciated it, but that part of town didn't seem all that scary to me... Perhaps my central Iowa folks can contradict me...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We checked in and got 4 hours of death-like sleep. At 7:30, Jenny was ready to get on the road again, but we had no idea what we were going to have to do. Would we need to rent a car? Could they fix ours? If we rented one, when would we be able to drive 4 hours back to pick ours up? Or would we ever be able to? All questions that we couldn't answer until we talked to the mechanic, but first I needed to figure out the insurance thing. Acuity is NOT a good company when you are in a crisis. They are well setup to accept payments and file claims during business hours, but in an emergency, you are on your own. In the middle of the night, that's a little scary, especially with all of the Progressive commercials that were playing on the TV. By 8:00, however, I was finally able to get ahold of my agent who wasn't much more help anyway - telling me that we were covered for the tow, but didn't know what else... I thanked him and realized that we were on our own... Time to grow up, I guess!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By now the kids had awoken and the TV had come on where National Lampoons Vacation was on. Hmm... Another omen??? Perhaps it would have been if it hadn't happened after the fact, but certainly coincidental! I called the repair place who had just gotten around to looking at the car. I was annoyed, but I later found out that the shop had 3 inches of standing water in it when they arrived and they spent all morning and much of the afternoon cleaning up and making the place functional again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By now the family was at a bit of a low point. Jenny desperately wanted to be home, or at least at a Starbucks (the nearest of which was 3 miles away). So the kids and I went out and got breakfast to pass the time until we could talk with the mechanic again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;30 minutes later, I called to ATC once again who informed me that they were able to start the car and we might have gotten lucky! Finally, good news!!! Of course, they wouldn't know for sure until they changed the oil and spark plugs and were able to test it some more. This raised the spirits considerably, but now we had to wait the prescribed 45 minutes before we called back. So we went for a walk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's not much to see along 33rd street on a humid Monday morning, but we walked nonetheless... When we got back an hour later, I called again, and they continued to be positive, thinking now that they would know for sure if we could drive the car in the next 15 minutes. Knowing Jenny and the kids were at their wits' end, I asked if he thought it would be OK if we just headed down there and waited for it. He said that would be fine, and if we could not ultimately drive it, he would give us a ride to the rental car place. Like I said, the folks in Cedar Rapids are quite friendly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tell the family that we're going to the car place, and there was much rejoicing. I called a cab and headed out to the lobby to check out. There I found out that we were REALLY small potatoes in this whole thing. There was apparently a hospital that had to evacuate one of their low-lying floors to another area, and the manager of the hotel awoke to find her truck submerged up to the windows! I started to feel a little badly, but got over it as the cabbie arrived to take us back to ATC.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After spending 90 minutes at the car repair place, outside, where they had setup their soaked lobby furniture while they mopped the whole place out, we paid our $400 bill (tow included) and were finally on our way again, delayed by almost exactly 12 hours! I discussed the situation with some of the employees of the auto repair place and they were very helpful in finding us a safe way back to Dubuque and the lands beyond. They mentioned that they were expecting more weather that afternoon, and quicker we got out of there the better. That turned out to be true as we were made aware of a tornado touchdown from one of our Facebook acquaintances that afternoon!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We drove straight through to Dubuque, about 70 minutes, where we got gas and lunch, and most importantly, Jenny got some Starbucks! The world looked normal again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We made it back to the Oconomowoc area just in time to pickup our dog, who had apparently barked his fool head off the entire time we were gone. The boarding house lady was VERY pleased to see him leave... Not sure what to do with him. I was glad to see him!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Home&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's 6:00 - we are finally home! We had spent several days putting together a gazebo for our deck prior to leaving on vacation, and we were worried that bad weather might have affected it while we were gone. We were pleased to see that it was unaffected by any weather the entire 6 days we were gone! There proved to be some weather coming in, though, so we quickly unpacked the car into the garage to beat the rain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jenny had packed pretty efficiently, so the unpacking was going fairly quickly. Quin was working on connecting up to Netflix again, something he had missed on the vacation, and Ethan was busy evacuating his bowels, something he had not apparently done properly for the prior 6 days since he was never afforded the requisite 30 minutes to do so. Jenny and I busied ourselves unpacking and we put a couple of frozen pizzas in the oven so we could get a quick supper. That's when the thunderstorm hit. The lights flickered 3 times - each time we heard a "come on!" from the bathroom. On the 4th time, they went out "for good." It was at that time that we heard the gazebo get blown off the deck... I guess the Kraken had more for us after all!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The severe thunderstorm lasted about 10 minutes, but it did some damage, and our power was still not coming back on. Nobody had the chance yet to shower or eat, the pizzas had been in the oven for only 8 minutes, only about 2/3 the time required. As I busied myself looking for flashlights (all of which seem to end up in Quin's room), Jenny finished unpacking. Ethan finished his business in the bathroom, and Quin desperately tried to watch something on Netflix!!! Foiled by the power! Also, the wind had blown the gazebo apart and pieces of it were lying on the ground out back...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a whim, we decide to call Jenny's sister who lives only 3 miles away to see if she has power. Oh, the power of the cellular telephone! They did have power, so we quickly brokered a deal to shower over there and hang out until our power was restored. When we got there, they had no idea of any of what had transpired over the last 18 hours. When they asked how our vacation was, Quin quickly exclaimed, "I won a Furby!!!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After an hour of waiting, drinking their beer, and using their shower, my rudimentary sleuthing techniques informed me that our power was back on, only 2 hours from when it had gone out. We headed back home, thankful for the company and the accommodations, but yearning for HOME!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that's where we sit now. I completed my shower once we got back, Quin quickly went to bed, Jenny started the prodigious job of catching up on the laundry, and Quin was able to finally download the Furby app and feed his now hungry little stuffed animal while he was finally able to watch Netflix!!! Life is back to normal - sure, we're 15 hours late, tired, have missed a day of school and a day of work (I wouldn't say I missed it), but we still have a roof over our heads and our power hungry appetites are satiated once more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a nice vacation, but it's REALLY good to be home!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/6243840306621851404/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=6243840306621851404' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/6243840306621851404'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/6243840306621851404'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2014/06/summer-vacation-2014-there-and-back.html' title='Summer Vacation 2014 - There and Back Again'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-2910011131796668623</id><published>2014-06-28T23:38:00.005-05:00</published><updated>2014-06-28T23:39:05.178-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Summer Vacation 2014 - Day 4 - Friday</title><content type='html'>Friday started our first full day at camp. We had hoped to get a vacation run in this morning, but alas, it was not meant to be. We were able to get moving in time for our 8:30 breakfast meet-up for new families. New families were quite the thing this year with the camp doubling in size or so over the last couple of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After breakfast we dropped the kids off with their age appropriate groups, each color coded by shirt color. Quin's group, the first graders, were colored red, and Ethan's group, the middle schoolers, were colored tan. The separation ceremony was done in the gym along with some African dance being taught to us by a local troupe of African dancers. We, and most others, were predictably inept at dancing, though Quin made up for the rest of us. Ethan didn't care to have any of us around him for the separation ceremony, but we could see him from across the gym and he looked typically uncomfortable, though he was trying, it was clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After dancing, the kids were off and we went to the auditorium for the adult program. The morning program involved "heritage camp speed dating." The room was split into four sections and each section was assigned a topic. If the topic applied to you, you went to that area. Jenny and I made a point of splitting up and took part in topics like "kids in middle school," "kids that have spent time in the foster system," and "kids that have spent time in orphanages." It was interesting to talk with people that were in similar situations to us. We found out pretty quickly that there was a very large contingent of people here that had adopted from Ethiopia. We also quickly established ourselves as some kind of minor celebrities. For one thing we had adopted domestically - that was pretty common. But very few had adopted domestically and were also in the process of adopting internationally. But what really set us apart was that we managed to drive 15 hours from Wisconsin to attend... In other words, we learned that most people at this conference were "locals."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jenny and my programs were quite interesting, and I'd love to blog at length about them, but the topics are likely pretty dry for the rest of the considerable leadership, so I'll skip the gory details. Lunch on Friday was catered from a local Ethiopian restaurant, which was delicious. Quin had a meat and cheese sandwich while Ethan got to got white water rafting with the other middle and high schoolers. All on-camp meals were served on an open field on the campus, and there was never a time when there wasn't at least 10 kids playing soccer. There also was never a time when Quin wasn't one of those at least 10 kids!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After lunch was much of the same as the morning. Quin went back to his programming, we went back to ours. The afternoon programs ended up at 4:00 at which time we collected Quin and waited around for Ethan. The rafters didn't end up coming back until close to 4:30. Apparently Ethan had a great time rafting and wants us all to do it again sometime. Quin met some good friends throughout the day as well, but it was time to get away from camp and do something else for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After camp, we went back to the hotel to swim a bit. I used some of my newly learned child psychology to have some fun with Quin in the pool while Jenny and Ethan rested in the room. After swimming we got ready and met my cousin, Caitlin, and her fiancé at the Bull and Bush, pretty much my favorite place on earth. Bull and Bush is an English style pub that brews their own beer and has better than average pub food. Caitlin and Paxton moved out here only a month ago after Caitlin got a job at a nearby museum. It was nice to see them. The most interesting part of the dinner, though, was how Quin literally slept through the entire meal and then some. The week's activities and messed up schedule had him completely wiped out, and he caught up on 3 hours worth in the car and on my lap around dinner time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After dinner we met Maylee and Steve again at their floor hockey game in Parker, just south of the city. After a couple of drinks and appetizers afterwards we finally went back to the room but didn't get there until 11:00, late once again! Looks like Quin is going to continue to be off schedule at least another day!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/2910011131796668623/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=2910011131796668623' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/2910011131796668623'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/2910011131796668623'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2014/06/summer-vacation-2014-days-4-friday.html' title='Summer Vacation 2014 - Day 4 - Friday'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-3994531348667137407</id><published>2014-06-27T00:04:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2014-06-27T00:04:00.749-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Summer Vacation 2014 - Days 1-3 - Tuednesday and Thursday</title><content type='html'>This year's edition of summer vacation is to the Mile High City where we are attending an African and Caribbean Heritage Camp. It's been a few years since we've been in Denver in the summer, so we were pretty excited to get things started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plan was to make the 15 hour drive from Tuesday through Wednesday morning. After 2/3 day of work, we packed up the car and... waited for Target to deliver some new patio furniture. That could have probably been planned better. They gave us a window from 2-6 on Tuesday. Luckily they turned up at 5:00. It seemed a little sketchy - they showed up in a Penske rental truck and had the back full of stuff. I don't recall if they had uniforms on. Very strange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We got on the road by 5:30 PM and started the trek, but first we had to drop Heinz off at his resort for the week, Nature's Touch Pet Boarding near Watertown. They were very excited to find out that Heinz would be spending the week with them (insert sarcastic look here). When I called them to make the reservation, they took my information and finally asked for my name. When I said "Grady," the woman said, "Oh great, Heinz." He is notorious for barking the entire time he stays there, so they will have had their fill of his annoying, high-pitched bark by next Monday! The road to the boarding house is a bit out of the way and on gravel roads. After the 25 minute drive we turned off on the last gravel road to deliver him, only to find that there was a bridge out right before the drop off. Ethan suggested that the owners might have destroyed the bridge instead of taking Heinz on as a tenant for the week. He might be right...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about a 6 mile detour to get back to drop Heinz off, the kids were getting hungry, so we stopped immediately at one of our favorite Culver's in Johnson Creek and had supper. Short story long, we were finally on the road for real by around 6:30 on Tuesday evening. No problem - we were planning to drive through the night anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that's just what we did. We split the trip up into quarters. Quarter 1 was to Cedar Rapids - we arrived there around 10:00. That one wasn't too bad - everybody was awake for all of that. the next quarter was to Omaha which we arrived at around 2:00, and most everybody was sleeping by then, including the driver. The third quarter was the roughest. I pulled over around 3:00 to let Jenny drive for a spell. After 2 hours, she had had enough, so we pulled over at a beautiful Nebraska rest stop and did just that, rested. After an hour break, the car windows were sufficiently steamed and we continued our journey, ending the third quarter near North Platte, NB around 7:00 in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks we hit the road for the final quarter of the trip, the final drive into Denver, where we arrived around 11:00.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tuednesday - felt like a single day, even though it was two, technically. Quin and Ethan got a decent amount of sleep on the trip, but Jenny and I were pretty cached. Our friends Maylee and Steve offered to let us stay with them for the first night of the trip, which was awesome. The first order of business, their awesome apartment pool, where we spent a couple of hours, after which we got some lunch and relaxed for the afternoon while taking in the World Cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The evening went by in a blur. We walked to get some dinner at the Lowry Beer Garden, then walked back, and Quin and I fell instantly to sleep. I had heard the phrase "as soon as my head hit the pillow," but this was the first time I experienced it myself. I agreed to "put Quin to sleep" that night, but I think it turned out the other way around. I'm not sure how Quin fell asleep that night, but Jenny assures me that he was sleeping when she got up there. 10 hours later I'm feeling mostly OK, but it's still hard to believe that 3 days occurred - it only felt like 2!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thursday was a mostly lazy day as well. Some more pool time, some lunch, then check into our hotel in Westminster, CO, near where our camp was taking place at Regis University, Denver, CO. The camp started at 4:30 where we checked in and took in the opening bar-b-que and social hour. It's always fun to go to these things and see other families that "look like us." Quin took off and played soccer for 90 minutes or so with a bunch of other kids while the rest of us mingled. We met some interesting people, most of which were from the Denver area. One couple we met was from Kansas, and turned out that the father does voice work for cartoons, and even voices some of my favorite characters! Always fun to get out and meet people!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the evening ended at Dave and Busters with some video games. Tomorrow the camp starts in earnest - Ethan gets to go whitewater rafting with the high schoolers. Jenny and I will be in different talks throughout the day. Quin will be doing some age appropriate games and other stuff. I'm sure there will be more interesting things to blog about tomorrow, but for now, it's sleepy time. I'm guessing it's going to take a few days to recover from that 2 hour sleep night that was Tuednesday.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/3994531348667137407/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=3994531348667137407' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/3994531348667137407'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/3994531348667137407'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2014/06/summer-vacation-2014-days-1-3.html' title='Summer Vacation 2014 - Days 1-3 - Tuednesday and Thursday'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-720443635256027875</id><published>2014-04-24T22:44:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2014-04-24T22:44:40.579-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Vacation'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Spring Break 2014 - Home!</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Raining again this morning. As we were packing our room, I was thinking on my post from last night and how I had forgotten to put some important color on it. After the mall, the three boys (Ethan, Quin, and Loudon) and I went swimming in the pool. After we had swum for awhile, a couple of young girls came in - I would estimate they were around 10 or 11 years old. At one point they went to sit in the hot tub, where Quin followed them. I didn't even notice he was gone... I was hanging with my nepphew, trying to show him how to float. A couple of minutes later, Quin comes jumping into the regular pool and asks me, quiely, "dad, where do we live?" I told him Oconomowoc, and he got out of the pool and went back to the hot tub. A couple of minutes later he did the same thing, this time asking what state we lived in... Then went back... It was kind of spooky how natural he was at working these two girls - I was at once impressed and taking notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This morning we got up, packed up, then went to Al and Araceli's house for breakfast with them and my parents. It was a wonderful breakfast and nice to spend time with the family before we headed home. The funniest part of the morning by far was when Quin asked Araceli, "Are you a Mexican?" She responded that she was, indeed, Mexican. He then asked her, "how did you get here?" I was somewhat mortified, but at the same time wanted to see where it went. She patiently explained to him that Mexico was just south of the US and even tried to show him on the globe that was handy. I think he lost interest... Still, it was pretty funny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast forward 5 hours and we're home. We've been making a tradition out of saving the last day of vacation for when we get home. It's just more comfortable here and sometimes it's nice to pretend that you don't have a bunch of stuff to do but still be comfortable. So that's what we're doing now. No laundry, no cooking, just relaxing with our own stuff. We even went to a movie, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, which I found quite entertaining. Might have been a bit much for Quin...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that's it for this year's spring break. Tomorrow we're back to almost normal. We have some work on the house to do, need to pick up the dog, and then it's on to a weekend full of soccer, the first of MANY weekends like that. It's been fun, but now life must go on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right; font-size: small; clear: both;" id="blogsy_footer"&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogsyapp.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogsyapp.com/images/blogsy_footer_icon.png" alt="Posted with Blogsy" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 5px;" width="20" height="20" /&gt;Posted with Blogsy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/720443635256027875/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=720443635256027875' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/720443635256027875'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/720443635256027875'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2014/04/spring-break-2014-home.html' title='Spring Break 2014 - Home!'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-3464800830653654151</id><published>2014-04-23T22:17:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2014-04-23T22:17:38.471-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Vacation'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Spring Break 2014 - Mall of America</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt; The day started REALLY late this morning. The plan was to meet Uncle Bryce and Loudon at the Mall of America (MOA) at 10:00 to do rides and other fun stuff. When 9:00 rolled around and we were still having difficulty getting Quin out of bed, we knew we were going to have to delay a bit. It seems that vacation finally caught up to the 6 year old, who went to bed at midnight the night previous and hadn't slept much to date. He sure made up for it last night!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a shower and a quick breakfast in the atrium (our hotel is pretty nice), we headed out of the room to travel to the mall. Not before we stopped in the lobby for some Starbucks, a vacation staple. While Jenny was procuring the sweet caffeinated beverages for us, the boys and I sat at leather chairs in the lobby having a quick business meeting where I insulted, fired, rehired, and ultimately praised them for their parts in our bunny business. It was a weird morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We got to the mall a few minutes early, so Ethan shopped for and purchased a new Jerry Garcia tie (he's obsessed), then the four of us hung out at the Microsoft store and played some XBox ONE. The hope was that we would ultimately convince Jenny that it was time to buy one of our own. Not to spoil the surprise, but we still do not own one...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 10:30 we met up with Bryce and Loudon and took in the rides at Nickelodeon World. Loudon is a natural and loves rides, and it turns out Quin is as well! He's now tall enough (50 inches) to go on all the rides himself. Ethan was a very good big brother and older cousin today and went on all of the rides with his younger proteges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bit of lunch and more rides later, we were thinking of leaving. The kids convinced us that it was a good idea to go on the log ride one more time. We had gone on earlier and Quin and I had gotten REALLY wet - well, Quin got completely soaked, and I got really wet. Since I had gotten so wet the last time, I gave my phone to Jenny to watch while I rode this time around, which was good since we went on it twice in a row (it was a very slow day at the park). Jenny took some video of us on the ride, and once we were done, I found that my phone had completely discharged again. Luckily there was an Apple store only about 100 feet away, so I went there to find out what was wrong with my phone, only to find that I needed a new battery (I really need a new phone, the iPhone 5 is NOT one of Apple's best products, unfortunately).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After dropping off my phone, we took Loudon back to the hotel with us to take in some swimming, then we headed back to uncle Blaine's house for some home-made supper made by Grandma and Grandpa, who we haven't seen for quite some time (a correction from yesterday, we have seen them since November, in fact we saw them in January at Vince's baptism). It was quite a nice dinner and good to see the grandparents and Araceli again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how here we sit again. A pretty low key evening. Quin's still up at 10:00, probably because he got 12 hours of sleep the night prior. Ethan and I are watching Friends while Jenny is watching something while "encouraging" Quin to sleep in the other room. Tomorrow is the last day in MN for us - we will be heading back home to WI for the final days of our vacation. Friday will be a vacation day despite the fact that we'll be home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: none;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Pupl4edV1lA/U1iCTe82LMI/AAAAAAAAhbY/PkmhgXN_uVs/s2048/Photo%25252020140423221723.jpg" target="_blank" style=""&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Pupl4edV1lA/U1iCTe82LMI/AAAAAAAAhbY/PkmhgXN_uVs/s500/Photo%25252020140423221723.jpg" id="blogsy-1398309458020.9563" class="alignnone" width="500" height="667" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.3em;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right; font-size: small; clear: both;" id="blogsy_footer"&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogsyapp.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogsyapp.com/images/blogsy_footer_icon.png" alt="Posted with Blogsy" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 5px;" width="20" height="20" /&gt;Posted with Blogsy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/3464800830653654151/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=3464800830653654151' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/3464800830653654151'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/3464800830653654151'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2014/04/spring-break-2014-mall-of-america.html' title='Spring Break 2014 - Mall of America'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Pupl4edV1lA/U1iCTe82LMI/AAAAAAAAhbY/PkmhgXN_uVs/s72-c/Photo%25252020140423221723.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-6771971729706871482</id><published>2014-04-22T21:58:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2014-04-22T21:58:11.721-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Spring Break 2014 - The Museum</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Ethan and I knocked one of our meager goals for this vacation off this morning, we had breakfast at Taco Bell! Yeah, we have lofty goals. We piled down a couple of waffle tacos and breakfast burritos each and headed into St. Paul to take in the Minnesota Museum of Science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MMS is one of the better science museums I've been to, quite honestly. We easily spent 3.5 hours there without even doing a movie! This included the dinosaur exhibit, which was very cool. I learned some interesting new things, in fact. I had no idea what a rennaissance of dinosaur discoveries we were in lately! I don't think I recognized a single dino in the exhibit, they were all new discoveries in the last 10 years or so. My favorite was an entire new class of dinosaurs, the "titanosaurs." Very cool name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We spent the better part of the day there. Around 1:00 or so we decided we should eat something. Since it was nice outside (well, sunny at least), we walked around downtown St. Paul in desparate search of something to eat. I suggested we take on one of the hotdog vendors in the square, but Jenny insisted we find something else. After strikingo out at Paluzza (or something named similarly), we finally ended up at The American Burger Bar. After a quick round of drinks, a vacation necessity, conversation switched to more esoteric topics. One such topic was that of ninjas (of course). Quin stated that he was, in fact, a ninja. Ethan said that ninjas don't talk, so there was no way he could be one. I stated that there could be some such thing as a "verbose ninja." Ethan asked what that was, and without hesitation Quin told him, "A ninja that talks but just doesn't tell his secrets." I wrote that one down because, dang, what a great and accurate description!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our original plan was to go to the zoo after lunch, but after eating, we decided we'd rather drive around a bit and hopefully get Quin to take a quick nap - he had gone to sleep at midnight the night before! So we tooled around Minneapolis for a bit, looked at all of the new sports arenas, saw the hole in the ground where the Metrodome used to be, and generally just farted around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After an hour or so of that, we finally headed back south and checked into our hotel. Well, we first went to the wrong hotel, then checked into the proper hotel. Dinner plans were with the Johnson's, one of the girls we grew up with and her family, at a Brew Pub like place in Apple Valley. Though the service was slow, the beer and the food were good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We transitioned back to our hotel for an hour or swimming, which brings us up to the present. Now, Ethan, Jenny and I are watching TV in one room while Quin finally sleeps in the other half of the suite (yeah, we went all out). Tomorrow promises rain and cold, so our plans have us inside most of the day at the mall. Hopefully Ethan and I fulfill the remainder of our meager goals, to see Captain America. Then it's off to see Grandpa and Grandma Grady for the first time since November as they stop off on their migration back to Neillsville for the summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: none;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5dnFdBWWYVw/U1csJ4KJngI/AAAAAAAAhYI/X6LhQc5SwUg/s2048/Photo%25252020140422215730.jpg" target="_blank" style=""&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5dnFdBWWYVw/U1csJ4KJngI/AAAAAAAAhYI/X6LhQc5SwUg/s500/Photo%25252020140422215730.jpg" id="blogsy-1398221893389.69" class="alignnone" alt="" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: none;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-nyOy532DLg4/U1csQBXqMYI/AAAAAAAAhYQ/EaIUe6rtddM/s2048/Photo%25252020140422215730.jpg" target="_blank" style=""&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-nyOy532DLg4/U1csQBXqMYI/AAAAAAAAhYQ/EaIUe6rtddM/s500/Photo%25252020140422215730.jpg" id="blogsy-1398221893382.008" class="alignnone" width="500" height="375" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right; font-size: small; clear: both;" id="blogsy_footer"&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogsyapp.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogsyapp.com/images/blogsy_footer_icon.png" alt="Posted with Blogsy" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 5px;" width="20" height="20" /&gt;Posted with Blogsy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/6771971729706871482/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=6771971729706871482' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/6771971729706871482'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/6771971729706871482'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2014/04/spring-break-2014-museum.html' title='Spring Break 2014 - The Museum'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5dnFdBWWYVw/U1csJ4KJngI/AAAAAAAAhYI/X6LhQc5SwUg/s72-c/Photo%25252020140422215730.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-6117030029435329115</id><published>2014-04-21T22:56:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2014-04-21T22:56:56.696-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Vacation'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Spring Break 2014 - Minnesota</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;We departed Neillsville sometime between 9:00 and 10:00 AM, right on schedule. Jenny's plans didn't have us overtaxing ourselves today. The plan was to hit a couple of tourist stops south of the Twin Cities, then drive up to spend the late afternoon/evening at Blaine's in Inver Grove Heights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our first stop was at &lt;a href="http://www.larktoys.com/" target="_blank" style="line-height: 1.3em;"&gt;LARK Toys&lt;/a&gt; in Kellogg Minnesota. This was not our typical drive for a vacation as it involved ZERO interstate time. Highway 10 to Mondovi, then meandered south to the river, across the river, you get the picture. It was picturesque, or would have been if there had been any leaves on the trees. We stopped in Mondovi for a soda as we were parched, and were surprised at how WARM it was outside! I think it's been so long since we've felt warm air that we didn't know how to respond, but the day was beautiful!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We pulled into Lark Toys around 11:15, parked, then went into the building. Quin still hadn't quite recovered from the prior evening's festivities, what with the tick and all, so he was cranky to say the least. What we found, however, was a nice toy store with a bunch of non-typical toys - things you can't find at WalMart! There were also a fair number of antique toys behind protective glass that was pretty neat. I had read the reviews the night prior to see what we were getting into, and the reviewer couldn't say enough about the carousel and how much fun they had having a "tea party" after riding the carousel. Well, I promised the boys that we would have an epic Tea Party, and Quin and I had that indeed. He was disappointed that there was no real tea, which he doesn't like anyway, but he was disappointed nonetheless. The reviewer said they spent 5 hours there and planned to come back 4 times a year. It was fun, but I guess if you don't have girls that appreciate the British afternoon custom for playtime, it might not be quite the same.&lt;a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-gi__KT45vnA/U1XofeIm4VI/AAAAAAAAhVE/S_0_tyoiRgE/s1280/Photo%25252020140421225639.jpg" target="_blank" style="line-height: 1.3em;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-gi__KT45vnA/U1XofeIm4VI/AAAAAAAAhVE/S_0_tyoiRgE/s500/Photo%25252020140421225639.jpg" id="blogsy-1398139015833.713" class="alignnone" alt="" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After "tea time" and purchasing some novelties that we didn't think we could find anywhere else, we got some lunch and officially started "spring break" with some umbrella drinks (as seen below). Ethan and Quin also got to ride the carousel, which was actually pretty cool, all of the animals were hand carved at the toy shop, and they were quite impressive!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: none;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--UeMnF8UnIk/U1XoheggpuI/AAAAAAAAhVM/cCUwWyrz-cc/s2048/Photo%25252020140421225639.jpg" target="_blank" style=""&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--UeMnF8UnIk/U1XoheggpuI/AAAAAAAAhVM/cCUwWyrz-cc/s500/Photo%25252020140421225639.jpg" id="blogsy-1398139015826.5562" class="alignnone" width="500" height="375" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt; We left Lark toys around 12:45, just shy of the 5 hours the Google reviewer promised, and headed north to Wabasha for the National Eagle Preserve on the river there. After paying our admission price, we were told that we could still get in on the 1:00 "show" where they told us all about their eagles and even fed one of them. We got in there just in time to see Angel, a 10 pound female Bald Eagle with a 7 foot wingspan, power her way through a raw rabbit carcass. Pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quin was pretty cranky by now, and we had seen enough eagle stuff - including a huge nest on the bridge crossing the Mississippi on the way over. So we decided to head north to Minneapolis, our ultimate destination for the evening. We arrived around 3:00 and had some time to burn, so we just drove around, a time honored tradition in our family. By 5:00 we called Blaine and hooked up with him and had some dinner at Ruby Tuesday, a fine establishment indeed. Blaine then bonded with his nephews while I took Jenny to a planned workout with a friend up here in the area - yeah, Jenny plans out workouts with friends in distant cities... While she was there, I headed up and visited with Bryce and the family - his boys are getting pretty big! In fact, Vincy is already 17 pounds!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right now we're huddled around the TV in Blaine's living room watching Rush Hour (Quin is still up, Jenny's asleep, Blaine is in bed). Tomorrow we go to our hotel where our "real vacation" begins according to Quin. We're also looking to hit the Science Museum, the zoo, and a brewpub before we get the kids into the pool to burn off some much needed energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right; font-size: small; clear: both;" id="blogsy_footer"&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogsyapp.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogsyapp.com/images/blogsy_footer_icon.png" alt="Posted with Blogsy" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 5px;" width="20" height="20" /&gt;Posted with Blogsy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/6117030029435329115/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=6117030029435329115' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/6117030029435329115'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/6117030029435329115'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2014/04/spring-break-2014-minnesota.html' title='Spring Break 2014 - Minnesota'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-gi__KT45vnA/U1XofeIm4VI/AAAAAAAAhVE/S_0_tyoiRgE/s72-c/Photo%25252020140421225639.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-2429809222066103646</id><published>2014-04-20T23:54:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2014-04-20T23:54:07.163-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Vacation'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><title type='text'>Vacation - "The Emergency"</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;Vacation just isn't vacation until there's a trip to the E.R. So today officially started our vacation!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This afternoon was pretty nice outside. It was around 60 degrees, not too much wind, so the kids went outside and played baseball. They were chasing the balls all around the property, including through some longer brush and what-not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a long day of playing, and a long night the night before, Quin was pretty tired. So around 7:30 we decided it was time to start what we thought would be a quick descent into sleepy time, starting with a bath. It was your typical bath, even though it was in a strange tub. Once he got out and was drying off, Quin was feeling around and discovered something strange on the underside of his "special purpose." He showed it to me, and I confirmed - a tick!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I gave it a couple of quick tries, not knowing what the protocol was for a dad to be messing around with his 6 year old's nether regions, but giving it an honest try. It wasn't long before I admitted defeat, however, and called up his more nimble fingered mother. Jenny worked at it for a bit before she, too, admitted defeat, and resorted to using tools instead, so she employed a tweezers. That's when things started to go downhill!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She managed to get the main portion of the tick removed with the tweezers, but this little guy was in there pretty good! There were a LOT of waterworks, a lot of screaming, and a lot of convincing him that we needed to try to get the head out of this. It was a mess! We tried pretty much everything, but after all was said and done, Quin looked at us and said, "listen to me! You're hurting my skin, and you're hurting me! Please stop!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we started talking through what we should do next. Should we call the doctor? What did the internet say? Was it a deer tick? Was the head really in there (it was)? Quin didn't much like listening to all of this - he didn't want to go to the Doctor! Of course, after a bit of digging around, and telling him that it wouldn't hurt to go to the doctor, he WANTED to go to the DOCTOR, PLEASE!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We gave up. We got him in his jammies and I fetched my cell phone and called the number I remember so well from my youth - 715.743.3101. I asked for the nurse on call, then I'll admit, I through my name out there expecting some special treatment (I didn't get any). The nurse informed me that she thought we should bring him in so the doctor could look at him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being Neillsville, we weren't expecting this to be too big a deal. It is only about a 10 minute ride to the hospital from pretty much anywhere in the zip code. Once we got there around 8:45, the parking lot was a bit fuller than would be expected. We checked in and were informed that it would probably be awhile - things were kind of busy. The waiting room had 2 other groups of people sitting already. We were lucky to have a television and remote to keep us company, and there was a baseball game on, so that worked out OK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 45 minutes later, we were the only ones left in the waiting area. I mentioned to Jenny that, unless there was an ambulance, we should be in shortly. It was quiet there, so we could hear the page coming in that the ambulance was inbound, something about shortness of breath, etc... Yep - bad luck!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the ambulance's arrival, we got in around 9:45 and they started taking vitals, height, and weight. Quin is 50 inches tall (something the tech was unable to figure out, unfortunately) and weighed 60 pounds! After a couple of minutes, Dr. Stanga came in and was able to confirm the existence of a tick head on the underside of Quin's penis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The doctor gave some orders and left the room. After numbing up the area, we were left alone with our little boy who had lots of questions. "Is it biting me? Why's it in there? Is it moving around?" At one point during our attempts, I explained to him that ticks had teeth that bit so hard that they wouldn't let go, to which Quin informed us that we should just "knock out it's teeth." "That would only hurt the tick, not me!" He continued on that line of thought at the doctor's office as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 10:30, tick head, along with just a little bit of Quinton's tender bits gone, and with antibiotics in hand (they treat for Lyme's in all cases, I guess), we were on our way back to the Tibbett's. Quin took his medicine and he and I went up to finally go to sleep - he did manage to sleep for an hour while we waited to get into the E.R. Of course, he was a little charged up now, so we had some interesting conversation while he tried to fall off to sleep:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why is my penis so special?" he asked me, referring back to when I was explaining to him why we had to go to the doctor's. I told him that every part of us is special. Conversation averted, or so I thought. "What do we use our penises for, just peeing?" "A few other things," I said. "How many?" he asked. "Oh, I don't know, six-or-seven." "Well, which is it, six or seven?" This went on for a while...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why did they say that's a bad place to get a tick?" he asked me? I explained that there are a lot of nerves in that area, and that it typically hurt especially bad. That got us into a whole discussion about nerves and what function they served to the body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After many more gripping questions (I'll include more if I remember them), he finally asked me, "can I mess around with my penis?" I told him maybe not tonight. Tomorrow would be OK, probably. "Well, tomorrow's kind of busy," he said. Never too busy to mess around with your penis... Maybe I shouldn't have said that to him, but I like to make a point of not lying to my children...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: none;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-r1aV1aEoHZI/U1Ska0Ow-JI/AAAAAAAAhTw/f2_yFVsJ3U0/s1280/Photo%25252020140420235346.jpg" target="_blank" style=""&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-r1aV1aEoHZI/U1Ska0Ow-JI/AAAAAAAAhTw/f2_yFVsJ3U0/s500/Photo%25252020140420235346.jpg" id="blogsy-1398056047508.869" class="alignnone" width="500" height="375" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="line-height: 1.3em;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right; font-size: small; clear: both;" id="blogsy_footer"&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogsyapp.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogsyapp.com/images/blogsy_footer_icon.png" alt="Posted with Blogsy" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 5px;" width="20" height="20" /&gt;Posted with Blogsy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/2429809222066103646/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=2429809222066103646' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/2429809222066103646'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/2429809222066103646'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2014/04/vacation-emergency.html' title='Vacation - &amp;quot;The Emergency&amp;quot;'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-r1aV1aEoHZI/U1Ska0Ow-JI/AAAAAAAAhTw/f2_yFVsJ3U0/s72-c/Photo%25252020140420235346.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-3745880339101535925</id><published>2014-04-20T13:32:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2014-04-20T13:32:01.360-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Vacation'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Spring Break 2014 - Happy Easter!</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt; Welcome to Grady Spring Break, 2014! The itenerary is quite extensive, to be sure, and the destinations exotic!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trip started yesterday where we left the house in the van around 9:00 AM, heading north! Yes, you read that correctly, we headed NORTH for spring break. Didn't say we were all that bright! The first stop was probably just off of MTV's list of destinations for this year's spring break, Neillsville, WI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK, so we're sort of mailing in Spring Break this year. Rather than doing something exotic with lots of driving or flying, we're going to hang out with family near places that we know and enjoy. This weekend we'll be staying with Jenny's family. In fact we just got back from Easter Mass this morning, and got to spend several hours with Jenny's siblings last night where we ate too much and got some outside time (it's above 50 degrees, which means outside time in Wisconsin!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today promises to be a nice lazy day. It will be just the Grady's and Tom and Shirley, something that rarely happens. Tomorrow we head to Minneapolis by way of Waubasha, MN, where some gigantic toy store and some eagle place are beconing us. Tomorrow night we'll be staying with my brother, Blaine, and then heading to the real highlight, Embassy Suites near the Mall of America. Should be a hoot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethan and I have two goals for this vacation. First, we want to eat breakfast at Taco Bell. Second, we want to see the new Captain America movie. Yeah, pretty ambitious. I hope we are able to pull it off!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until then, I'll share pictures as I get them. I'm sure we'll be putting something together for more mass sharing as we get back and synchronize up from our big, non-internet connected camera. Below is a sample of what we're doing today - playing on our devices... That's kind of what we do these days...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: none;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-r5nPYc2oYRE/U1QSl6qAVoI/AAAAAAAAhPk/U4RleOlb65Q/s2048/Photo%25252020140420133112.jpg" target="_blank" style=""&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-r5nPYc2oYRE/U1QSl6qAVoI/AAAAAAAAhPk/U4RleOlb65Q/s500/Photo%25252020140420133112.jpg" id="blogsy-1398018714838.7087" class="alignnone" width="500" height="375" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right; font-size: small; clear: both;" id="blogsy_footer"&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogsyapp.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogsyapp.com/images/blogsy_footer_icon.png" alt="Posted with Blogsy" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 5px;" width="20" height="20" /&gt;Posted with Blogsy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/3745880339101535925/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=3745880339101535925' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/3745880339101535925'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/3745880339101535925'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2014/04/spring-break-2014-happy-easter.html' title='Spring Break 2014 - Happy Easter!'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-r5nPYc2oYRE/U1QSl6qAVoI/AAAAAAAAhPk/U4RleOlb65Q/s72-c/Photo%25252020140420133112.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-4936928374106531726</id><published>2014-02-16T07:43:00.002-06:00</published><updated>2014-02-16T07:43:19.938-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>6 years ago today...</title><content type='html'>It was Saturday. I don't remember many of the details of the day, unfortunately, but what I do remember is that we got the call that the birth mother had finally completed the harrowing experience of giving birth to who would come to be our child through the institution of domestic adoption. Over the years we've found that we've been given the gift of a wonderful, healthy, smart, and strong boy with whom we get to spend time with, learn from, be perplexed and frustrated by, and love on a day to day basis. It's been a wild ride and I can't wait to find out what's next!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today we will celebrate his birth, a delivery story that matched Ethan's almost to the detail save for the fact that he had a different birth mother! We'll start out by going out to breakfast - a buffet at the local brewpub. Quin would have rather gone to Noodles, his favorite, but we convinced him that their breakfast wasn't very good... After breakfast we'll go to the Lego Movie, then home for some sledding as the weather is continuing to cooperate with the winter outdoor enthusiast this year! Finally we'll retire to the home for some spaghetti and "mozzallalla sticks" with some friends. It should be a rollicking good time, to be sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beyond birthdays, Quin continues to keep us on our toes. I've told the story of how he frequently tells us about getting a new mom whenever he sees a lady that he finds attractive (I still can't believe that's a thing for a 5, well 6 year old). Lately he's switched this up by simply saying something like, "Ooh, there's a sexy lady!" He also likes to tell us that he knows how "sexy ladies dress," after which he will lift his shirt and show us his midriff. And if I haven't blogged about the "big long boobs" story yet, remind me to tell you the next time I see you. I think I did write about it, but it deserves multiple mentions... All of this may be an indication that he's starting to have some empathy, however. The other morning he started saying that he wanted a new dad, but caught himself mid sentence and amended his statement to say, "Dad, I don't want a new dad, but I wish God had made you so you didn't fart so much." See? Empathy...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not all about the ladies, though, he's also quite curious and thoughtful. I believe I've discussed his deep questions about how remote controls and light switches work. His latest query was asking how puddles disappear. That's one benefit to having children that I never would have thought of - they actually force you to relearn and understand the things that you had cursory knowledge of in the past. I'm actually embarrassed how little I knew the first time through school, but am happy for the opportunity to go through it again through my kids' experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quin certainly appears to have an interesting inner dialog going on at all times. He's very much enjoying playing sports video games (FIFA 14 is his favorite right now - thanks uncles Blaine and Bryce), his 3DS, and Floppy Bird (sadly he was able to download it before the developer took it down). Yesterday when he was playing Floppy Bird and trying to beat his record, he kept chanting "Believe in yourself, Quinton!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm also fairly convinced that Quin may be the black Bart Simpson sometimes. Last week he was doing some homework while Ethan and I were tossing a ball back and forth (yeah, I'm a good roll model - tossing a ball around in the house). Jenny helped him get started on the assignment which was to copy four new sight words which were provided on the left into a space on the right. Then below those words he was supposed to write out four sight words that he had learned in the past. As an aside, it constantly amazes me what Kindergarteners are doing now versus when I was a kid. I'm pretty sure the most complex thing I did in kindergarten was to cover a pinecone with peanut butter and roll it in bird seed. But anyway, Jenny left for a couple of minutes and came back to check up on Quinton's progress when she exclaimed, "Butt!!?" I looked over at the page and all he had accomplished to write in the provided spaces was "butt," a word that one of his buddies had just taught him to spell the day before. Being the good father I am, I managed to almost make it out of earshot prior to cracking up so Jenny could dole out an appropriate response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, this one just cracks me up so I need to put it in here somewhere. I get a kick out of people that mess up the lyrics to songs. One of my favorite ones was from Tim Z's brother who used to sing "Big Ole Jed Left the Light On" instead of "Big Old Jet Airliner." Quin has his own version of Maroon Five's "Move Like Jagger" where he sings "Move My Pajamas."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;object width="320" height="266" class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="https://ytimg.googleusercontent.com/vi/iEPTlhBmwRg/0.jpg"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="https://youtube.googleapis.com/v/iEPTlhBmwRg&amp;source=uds" /&gt;&lt;param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /&gt;&lt;embed width="320" height="266"  src="https://youtube.googleapis.com/v/iEPTlhBmwRg&amp;source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;Well, he's up now, so I must close this out.

With a new year comes a renewed hope that I will actually keep this thing up to date. Here goes this week's attempt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quin continues to grow up fast. Despite that, he still has the occasional accident at night where he wets his bed - and when he does, he wets it epically (his word). So we typically put him in a pull-up in the evening, which he takes like a good sport. A couple of mornings ago, I had just gotten done going for a run and was getting ready to take a shower. In our house, modesty is laughed at, so I was trekking from my bedroom to the bathroom, where Quin was using the toilet, without any clothing on. Since I had just gotten done running, I had the imprint of my elastic band shorts around my waist. Quin took a look at me, unfazed by the fact that I was completely nude, and gave me a concerned look. He pointed and said, "that hurts, doesn't it!" I didn't know what he was talking about, so I pressed him for details. He pointed at the imprint of my elastic band shorts and said, "there, where your pullup was. That hurts. I know!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're also trying to do our best to provide Quin with some positive black role models. It's no small feat living in an area where the school system boasts a 99% white population and 1% "other." But Jenny is quite determined, so she found a class that taught Hip-Hop Dance that had an African-American male teacher named Paul. We kept asking Quin if he wanted to try it out, but he continually said no. Finally, being the good parents we are, we tricked him and took him there anyway. Upon arrival at the studio, Quin finally asked where we were. We responded that we were at the dance class. To his credit, he didn't lose his cool - he just stated plainly that "I don't want to show off all my moves here..."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those wondering, we're still working on our adoption of Mireille, our daughter in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We have completed most hurdles, but the final ones are eluding us due to various circumstances. I will blog at length about them in coming weeks, particularly if the logjam clears somehow. Just know that we are anxiously awaiting the arrival of our daughter on US soil, and are starting to feel the need to learn French.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peace.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/2442916525502882822/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=2442916525502882822' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/2442916525502882822'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/2442916525502882822'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2014/01/quinny-quickies.html' title='Quinny Quickies'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-8513012384577184118</id><published>2013-10-19T16:11:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2013-10-19T16:11:46.744-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Couple of Quick Updates</title><content type='html'>We just got back from a vacation in our nation's capital. This post is not about that, however, but I wanted to warn you that an update's coming about that in the coming days/weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of quick ones, though. First, Ethan has had a couple of milestones in the last few weeks. As a seventh grader, Ethan decided he was going to run for his school's student council as the vice president. At first he was quite excited as he thought he was running unopposed. In the days after deciding to run, however, he found out that he would have an opponent after all - and worse yet, he was running against an eighth grade girl. Undeterred he crafted a speech and started a social media campaign (OK, I'm exaggerating about the social media campaign, but that would have been cool) and ended up winning the post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethan's other big accomplishment is that he has finally won the costume contest at his school's harvest dance. He's always had a thing for dressing in costumes. Typically he starts planning his Halloween costume on November 1. This year he went as a convincing Napoleon Dynamite and was finally awarded best costume. Personally I didn't think it was quite as good as his Weird Al costume last year, but he does have many of Napoleon's tendencies... Just now he asked me for some chapstick because his "lips hurt real bad!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, a continuation of the updates on Quin's obsession with the fairer sex, and yet another indication of how nurture might play a big part in a child's upbringing (I'm getting in trouble for this one I think). Quin's main female influence is Jenny, his mom. He also has a good eye for pretty girls. So many times when he sees a pretty girl he says that he wants her to be his mom... We've explained that he already has two moms, but he just insists that he'd now like three moms... Anyway, the other night Ethan was watching Saturday Night Live (yes, the bad parenting continues) where Katie Parry was the musical guest. Quin was enamored, staring at the screen for the entire performance. Afterwards when Jenny was putting him to bed he told her that he wanted another mom, a really "beautiful one with big, long boobs." I have no idea where he might have gotten that, I swear!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/8513012384577184118/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=8513012384577184118' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/8513012384577184118'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/8513012384577184118'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2013/10/couple-of-quick-updates.html' title='Couple of Quick Updates'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-1394841800863827434</id><published>2013-09-04T17:48:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2013-09-04T17:48:04.460-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Too funny to pass up...</title><content type='html'>I haven't blogged in awhile. Part of it is sheer laziness. That compounds on itself in that there are just too many things to blog about so I just can't find the time to get it done. I'm in that situation right now. But something happened a couple of weeks ago that was too funny not to document - so here goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We went to Noah's Ark - America's Largest Waterpark - last week for a last ditch summer celebration. To set the tone (since I can't tell a short story), I am building a deck, and had the guy coming out to auger the holes for the footings in the morning. My assumption was that he was going to be there for about an hour, from 8:00 until 9:00 or so, then we would leave after that. Well, that didn't exactly happen as planned. He was there for almost 2.5 hours, and the fun vacation day to the Dells started out with one very angry wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No matter - we got to the park just in time to meet our friends and consume our picnic lunch that we had packed to save on money inside the park. As we were setting up our feast, Quinton and I went to the gate to purchase our tickets. As I was waiting in line to pay for and retrieve the tickets, Quin was watching all of the people walk by. At one point he said, almost under his breath, but loud enough for me to hear, "wow, there are a lot of pretty girls here." Later in the day he lost the shyness and started addressing people directly by saying, "Hello pretty girl!" to whoever he deemed worthy as they passed him in the park. Yes, funny and cute now... I'm not sure at what point it turns creepy, though. I told Ethan that he had most definitely crossed that line.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/1394841800863827434/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=1394841800863827434' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/1394841800863827434'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/1394841800863827434'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2013/09/too-funny-to-pass-up.html' title='Too funny to pass up...'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-4771877353635398890</id><published>2013-04-10T22:32:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2013-04-10T22:32:17.070-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Vacation'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Ethan'/><title type='text'>Sweet Vacation - Alabama</title><content type='html'>&lt;h2&gt; Home at last!&lt;/h2&gt;Strange way to start a blog about our vacation to Alabama, but I ended up not really writing during the vacation - something I'm sure I'll regret in the end as I'm sure there is some level of excruciating detail that I will miss out on by not doing this in real time, but in the end I'm sure it will save you, dear reader, from the droning on that would undoubtedly result from a real-time, blow-by-blow that I would have otherwise forced you to endure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We returned from our vacation on Friday night, April 5, at around 9:30 PM, after having driven almost 9 hours that day. We stopped leisurely from time to time, hung out at a cave for awhile - well, I suppose I'm getting ahead of myself. I can cover that when we get to it chronologically. Unofficially I'm titling this vacation, the Broken Glass Vacation for reasons that I'll get to shortly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those looking for the Cliff's Notes version, we went to Orange Beach Alabama, stopping at Indianapolis, IN, Nashville, TN, and Birmingham, AL along the way. We celebrated Easter with some southern Catholics, enjoyed 4 days in a condo with 3 other families with whom we are familiar, then traveled back. There were two days of sun, some rainy, chilly days, and lots of relaxation along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, if you're still in - here's the unabridged version... For the abridged version, please visit my &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/photos/115749026413078959590/albums/5863830498626276657?authkey=CKGhmcfooKDBWw"&gt;Google+ Photo Album at this link.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Thursday, March 28, 2013 - Home to Indianapolis, IN&lt;/h2&gt;This day actually started like any other for me, at work. Our plan was to start our travel after work and school, but since school was only a half day affair today, I bolted out of work a little early. I hurriedly dropped Heinz off at his vacation destination, Tender Touch Pet Grooming and Boarding, then raced back to pack up the last of our vacation luggage along with the family to start our great adventure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, the plan was to leave after work. The thought being that we could put a few hours, and Chicago, behind us, get some rest, then take our sweet time on our way to Nashville the next day. As plans go, it was a pretty good one, and it worked out as expected. We got out of the house around 4:30, in time for Milwaukee rush hour traffic, but luckily it wasn't (nor ever is) very bad. We reached Kenosha around 5:30 in time for our first vacation meal, the exotic restaurant known as Wendy's.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few more hours in the car and a timezone later we reached south Indianapolis and found a decent Best Western hotel to hunker down for the night. It was 11:30 local time when we stopped, 10:30 home time. We were tired, but the room was very nice. When I inquired about availability and rates I was told that they did not have any double queens, but did have a double king! "Normally it was $79, but for you, Mr. Grady, I can give it to you for $71." Sold. Jenny had ingeniously packed a smaller suitcase just for the voyage portion of the vacation, so we grabbed that, the toiletries, and the kids, and rushed into the hotel so we could quickly sleep. While grabbing the stuff, however, we suffered our first fight of the voyage, I had apparently forgotten to plug up the drain of the cooler, so now we had a huge wet spot on the floor of the van that is still there today (10 days later), which also managed to wet my computer bag and our toiletries. Luckily, nothing was permanently damaged, and our stuff mostly dried over the next two evenings on the hotel heaters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Friday, March 29, 2013 - The Road to Nashville, TN&lt;/h2&gt;As a general rule, we never set an alarm throughout the entirety of the vacation, so we didn't even stir until around 8:30 local time. After stirring and collecting our things, we checked out of the Best Western and walked over to Bob Evans for some breakfast. We all ordered, getting the mandatory breakfast meat staple, bacon, with each meal. Ethan realized too late, however, that it was a Friday during Lent, so he graciously donated his bacon to Quin who had gotten sausage (or as he pronounces it, shaushage) with his meal. Jenny and I powered through it hoping God would forgive us this one minor transgression... I guess Ethan has more to worry about than us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After gassing up, we left Indianapolis and headed south. One of our group was traveling slightly in front of us and contacted us to mention that we should visit a place at Exit 0 in Indiana where they have a state park called the Falls of the Ohio. We stopped around noon, got out of the car, walked around a bit, and took in the "falls." Perhaps I didn't read enough about the place, but these falls looked entirely manmade. No matter, it was nice to get out in the sun, something we still hadn't seen much of, and stretch our legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right over the bridge of the Falls is Louisville, KY, home of Kentucky Fried Chicken and UPS. Though our trip through there was brief, it seemed like a place we'd like to come back to visit sometime in the future. For one it's only about a 7-8 hour drive from home, making it achievable in the "long weekend" category. For another, there seems a lot to do there, from the Louisville Slugger museum to the horse racing track. There were also plenty of caves in the area and distilleries slightly south of there. Mental note, head back to Louisville someday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plan of the day was to only drive about 5 hours, as Nashville was our destination for the evening. Even with the late start, a 5 hour drive to Nashville would have left us too much time to waste there, so we opted to take in Mammoth Caves National Park in southern Kentucky that afternoon. Again being contacted by our travel companion who was a couple hours ahead of us, we were alerted that Mammoth Caves was particularly busy despite the cold, rainy conditions. We decided to try it out anyway, and arrived there around 1:30 local time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jenny quickly made her way to reserve tickets on the guided "Discovery" tour while the boys and I found a place to park the van. It wasn't particularly nice out - it was raining and in the low 50s, but we were on vacation in the south, so we were in shorts, dammit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our tickets gave us access to the 3:00 tour, which gave us a little while to get some food and walk around a bit. Despite that fact that this was allegedly one of their busiest days of the year, there was only a single, 10 table cafe open to get food. It didn't matter, though - we were seated after a short wait and opted this time to follow the example of our much more disciplined 11 year old and ordered fish and grilled cheese sandwiches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After lunch we walked briefly around the area to find some hiking trails and other cave entrances around the property. Quin asked if we were going to see any bats in the cave. Jenny said we might, but he said he didn't really want to see any - he was afraid because bats turn into Vampires! Hard to argue with that logic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After going through a nice museum area, it was finally time for us to take our 75 minute guided tour of some of the larger areas of the cave. Apparently Mammoth Cave is the longest known cave in the world. As of February of this year, man has discovered 400 miles of cave. Our guide informed us that experts estimate there are more than 200 miles that have yet to be charted! Our tour was through the historical entrance, the largest natural entrance of the cave system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In truth, the tour was kind of boring. The cave was impressive, no doubt, but we didn't really get to go anywhere that any aging, overweight midwesterner couldn't go with their rascal scooter - except for the 60+ steps that we had to traverse to get to the entrance. Regardless, we did find out some interesting stories about the cave. Like at one point a doctor believed the cave air to have healing qualities, so he would take people with consumption (turbuculosis) down there where they would live for months at a time. While they were there, other people would continue to tour the caves, and often times would report seeing ghosts, which they believe were nothing more than the consumption patients being seen from a distance, their pallid, white skin from spending months without sun and the dark circles around their eyes from a lack of sleep giving them the distinct look of a ghost. If and when we go back, we hope to do one of the more adventurous tours that take more time to some of the more interesting areas of the cave. The spots we saw were completely dry and very large.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We left the cave thinking we had another 2-3 hours of driving before we reached our destination for the night, Brentwood, TN, just south of Nashville. Jenny's company is headquartered there, so her connections gave us the scoop on the best places to stay while in Nashville. Unfortunately we were met with bad traffic south of the caves. REALLY bad traffic, and it didn't abate for the rest of the day. Apparently there were more people than us traveling south for the Easter holiday. It took us another 5 hours past the caves to finally reach our destination!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tired, sore, and ornery, we finally arrived at the Courtyard in Brentwood. I dropped the family off and we argued briefly about what we should do for dinner. We finally decided on pizza. I engaged my trusty iPhone to find a proper pizza place as well as somewhere to buy beer to officially start the vacation off with something locally brewed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered a pizza from Sal's, a place that promised to be only 1.5 miles from the hotel, and also located a liquor store. Since the pizza was 30 minutes until complete, I meandered to the liquor store first. If you don't already know, I am a bit of a beer snob. I like to try lots of different beers, and my favorite one is whatever is local. Whatever the case, I like variety. This liquor store was huge, but had only a single cooler full of mostly BMC (Bud, Miller, Coors) in it. I eventually located something that looked OK and was locally brewed, but was unable to find anything for my wife, whose pallet is a bit more particular. No matter, I was sure I'd run across something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Off to get the pizza, I found out it was an actual restaurant, not a carry-out place, so there was little in the line of carry out plastic ware or drinks for the kids. So after getting the pizza, I had to hit the road again to find a grocery store to score those items as well as, hopefully, some beer for Jenny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 90 minutes, I finally made it back to the hotel, devoid of anything for my wife to drink, so I abstained myself - vacation would have to wait to start for another night. After scarfing down pizza, garlic bread, and salad, we put our swimming suits on and headed out in search of the pool that was promised on the website. Quin was crawling out of his skin waiting to get active! Alas, we didn't read the fine print well enough, as the pool was outdoor, and it was cold and rainy outside. Disappointed, we went back to the room and settled for watching TV for an hour before turning out the lights and going to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Saturday, March 30, 2013 - Taking in Nashville, TN&lt;/h2&gt;Saturday morning seemed much nicer. It wasn't a lot warmer, probably low 50s, but it wasn't raining! I plotted a course and took a quick run in the morning while Jenny and the kids got ready. After a shower, we checked out and got some breakfast at McDonalds before heading into Nashville for the day. We didn't really have anything planned, but after the disappointment of the pool from the night before, we figured it better to do something the kids would enjoy and sacrifice our own interests of local history and brewing. So we located the Nashville Adventure Science Center. The entry fee was high, but we ended up spending almost 3 hours in the different areas from the human body exhibit to the solar system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three hours was about enough, too. By then it was time to meet up with the Zieglers who had been traveling since 3:00 that morning to reach Nashville by lunch. We selected a nearby brewpub and finally got the vacation started with a much deserved beer and lunch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After lunch, Laura had scoped out a park called the &lt;a href="http://www.nashville-vacation-fun.com/nashville-dragon-park.html"&gt;Fannie Mae Dees Park&lt;/a&gt; that featured a large mosaic dragon as its centerpiece, which turned out to be right next door to Vanderbilt University. We spent the better part of 2 hours just running around the park before we finally departed for Birmingham, our final stop before making the final push to Orange Beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our trip was relatively short today, only 3 hours from Nashville to Birmingham. Everything seems so close together in the south! For the most part it went without incident - that is until we were struck in the windshield by something hard. Expecting to see a chip in the windshield we were at first disappointed. About an hour later, however, we noticed a 4 inch crack along with the chip we had anticipated near the left edge of the driver's side. Looks like we're going to need a new windshield!&lt;br /&gt;We made it to Birmingham with relative ease, getting lost only briefly due to Google's inability to find the Hoover Courtyard. After finally locating it, Ethan and I went out to get the family Mexican food for supper. Along the way I was searching for a radio station to listen to, finding only sports talk radio and Christian rock - I was delighted to finally locate a classic hip-hop station. Stuff from my youth - apparently I'm old enough to have listened to classics now! Ethan was less than impressed with the raps - they didn't sample any other song or have a catchy chorus, they just rapped...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mexican dinner in our bellies and a couple of beers and we were out for the count for yet another night. Tomorrow was Easter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Sunday, March 31, 2013 - Happy Easter!&lt;/h2&gt;Before going to bed, we located a nearby Catholic Church and determined that the 8:30 mass was our best bet, the next one being at 11:00. Our goal was to get to Orange Beach by 5:00, so we'd have to leave town by 11:30 at the latest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first time we set an alarm for 7:00. The kids slowly awoke and found their Easter baskets along with a couple of Easter eggs that the Easter Bunny had hid for them. Quin was delighted to get a movie, the Rise of the Guardians, and also found Ethan's basket by accident. There are only so many places to hide things in a double queen hotel room!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We got to church pretty early, a little past 8:00, to find the previous 7:00 mass was just letting out. That bode well for us - we were expecting a mass of reasonable duration. As we walked in, a younger Korean priest greeted us in the entry way. Seemed friendly enough. We had high expectations for this mass having had a wonderful Easter mass in Branson, MO a few years prior. Apparently those expectations were a little off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the southerners were nice enough, but we were hoping for a little more diversity. We did identify one black family, and another family that looked of Asian decent, but the rest all looked like they were on the same branch of the Alabama white family tree. About 5 minutes before mass was to start, an elderly priest planted himself at the throne on the altar and appeared to fall asleep. For the next 90 minutes we were tortured by this old codger as he performed the mass, mostly from his chair. He got up to give his sermon, which rambled for awhile and followed about 6 different trains of thought, ranging from Hitler to some British Easter song he learned as a boy (he appeared to have an Irish accent). He got lost in several places during the mass, my guess is because they changed it on him again in the past 12 months! And with your spirit, indeed! A few times he repeated entire sections of the mass. Sometimes he would study his mass aid for what seemed like minutes on end trying to find his spot. In all, the mass lasted about an hour and 40 minutes, not significantly longer than what we are used to, but many times more torturous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We found ourselves with less time than we had anticipated after church, so we decided we'd just get some food for the road after a quick grocery run to Target. Unfortunately, Target was closed, so we settled for groceries and donuts from Wal Mart, then south we headed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were informed by Jenny's coworkers that Birmingham was the last decent place to stay before we got to Orange Beach. Along the way we encountered Clansville (seriously the name) as well as a monument to the Sons of the South proudly flying a Confederate Flag. We also found out that day that we had narrowly missed a Klan rally in Memphis, sure, in Tennessee, but the south seems like one big place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After what seemed like an eternity, particularly the last hour, we finally arrived at our home for the next few days, the Caribe resort in Orange Beach, Alabama. Tim Z. had arrived before us and informed us that the place was so nice he felt like a drug dealer! When we got into our room about 5:00 PM, we were not disappointed. The room was gigantic. I think I read 1400 square feet. We had a massive master bedroom suite with a king size bed, a second bedroom with 2 twin beds and a bathroom, and a large, open Kitchen and living area, complete with modern appliances and ice maker! We had a feeling we were going to get spoiled. The boys were thrilled that they had a TV in their room! With HBO!!!&lt;br /&gt;It was cool there, a little better than 60 degrees, but it was warm enough for us! We quickly got into swimming gear and got to swimming. The resort had 3 large outdoor pool areas as well as three heated indoor pools. We took on the outdoor lazy river for a bit before we retired to the indoor pool for the remainder of the evening. As we were walking around in our suits scoping out the pool situation, Quin couldn't help but jump into every pool we passed. He &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;likes swimming pools, and after the disappointment of outdoor, cold pools on the way down, he couldn't wait even a second longer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We settled in for the evening - Quin didn't really want to go to sleep yet, and Ethan didn't want him in their room for some reason, so he lay down in the king size bed watching something on TV while Ethan watched something in their room. Jenny and I relaxed to a beer and discussed what we would do the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That night, Ethan and I put a plan in place for a good April Fool's joke on mom the next day. The idea was that he would wake up, come into our room, and tell Jenny that Quin wasn't in there and ask very calmly where he was. He was in, so the plan was set...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Monday, April 1, 2013 - April Fools!&lt;/h2&gt;To my dismay, but completely expectedly, Quin woke up first - our April Fool's plans were dashed! No matter, Jenny and I decided we would go for a quick run and let the boys hang out in the room under Ethan's supervision. That set the stage - new plan! While Jenny dressed, Ethan, Quin, and I made final arrangements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a nice beach run, Jenny and I returned to the room about 50 minutes later. Jenny didn't know, but I texted Ethan who had Jenny's phone just as we were walking in. Prior to us leaving, Ethan asked us if they could go to the arcade which was just outside our room. We said no... When we got back to the room, though, he (trying to be straight faced) told Jenny that he didn't think anything would happen, so they went to the arcade anyway. Somewhere along the way, Quin slipped off, and he couldn't find him. Jenny didn't believe him - he had a smirk on his face the whole time despite his best efforts. The kids played it up well enough that Jenny freaked out, just a little bit, at which time the three of us exclaimed, "April Fools!" Worked about as well as we could have hoped...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We opted for an unscheduled day, so we hit the beach, a short, 5 minute walk from our resort. The beaches in this area are beautiful! The sand is completely white and very fine. It wasn't really hot, about 78 degrees, so the sand never really got too hot to walk on either, though I imagine in the summer it might get that way. The kids did a little swimming in the gulf, but mostly we played in the sand.&lt;br /&gt;After lunch, we took in the pools of the area again, hitting the lazy river once again. Later in the afternoon we met the Zieglers for a seafood dinner at Flippers, which was near where their Dolphin Cruise had embarked. The food was pretty decent and reasonably priced...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That evening, our dirty boys needed to bathe! It's never an easy task to get Ethan to bathe, for some reason, though he requires washing daily. Quin is a little easier, usually, but on this trip he wanted to take a bath every day once I introduced him to the whirlpool tub! One bath in there and he was hooked. On Tuesday he actually requested that he be able to take a bath in the "Super Tub!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monday was a good vacation day. There wasn't too much to write about... We drifted off to sleep in much the same way we did the night before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tuesday, April 2, 2013 - Vacation...&lt;/h2&gt;Tuesday promised to be nice again. Jenny was thrilled as she had been fretting about the weather the entire week leading up to vacation. It was sunny and warming again, so Jenny and I took advantage of our older child once again and went for a beach and bridge run. After our run, the day turned out much the same as the day prior, except this time we picked a new location on the beach, closer to the gulf. There we were able to collect copious amounts of seashells, build sandcastles, bury Ethan and Quin in the sand up to their heads, do some body surfing, and eat a simple beach lunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After lunch we again went back to the lazy river, but retired early to the room to get some rest before a planned group dinner later that evening. While in the room, Quin had taken to taking my iPad and watching Netflix movies on it. He was doing the same thing with his wind-down period this afternoon. At one point, though, he wanted a snack, so he traveled from his perch in his bed to the kitchen over the tiled floor. He also tried the trip with the iPad. On his way there, I heard a crash... The iPad had met with a rather noisy collision with the tiled floor. He continued in to the living room area and acted as though nothing had happened. I asked him if he dropped the iPad - he casually said Yes. I took it from him, examined it, and noted that there appeared to only be a small dent in the upper left corner of the metal casing. Looks like we dodged a bullet - that was until I examined it again later to find a fairly serious crack in the glass on the bottom of the unit. The second broken glass incident of the trip...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That evening we met up with the rest of the group for dinner at Tacky Jacks, a seafood restaurant in town. We got there about 5:45 and were told we would have to wait about 45 minutes for a table. While waiting for our table, the Zieglers told us that Logan had informed him that he "loved Quin." "Quin likes to do all the same stuff I do, like run around, throw stuff, play in the sand, etc." Apparently he was ecstatic to play with another boy having only his sister to do stuff with most of the time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We finally got our table by nearly 7:00. We ordered drinks and appetizers and eventually ordered our food when we were told that food was taking about an hour to get out once you ordered... The Chovanecs were traveling with a diabetic, so that wasn't going to work - they asked nicely to get some food early for him, which they were granted, but the rest of us waited until well after 8:00 when they finally delivered 1/3 of our food! Somehow they had forgotten or lost the remaining 8 meals!!! Somebody came out and tried to sort it out, taking all of our orders again, and this time, miraculously, it took only 15 more minutes for our food to get there... The server apologized and even promised that the manager would come over to talk with us - we never met with that manager and were delivered the bill with an automatic 18% gratuity added...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What promised to be a nice early night back in turned into a late one in a hurry, so we were back in the room and sleeping in short order...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Wednesday, April 3, 2013 - Rain&lt;/h2&gt;Wednesday turned out to be a blessing in disguise. It was raining fairly hard when we woke up, so we skipped the run, and instead started planning for rainy days in South Alabama. Ethan was happy for a break from the sun having suffered a minor sunburn in the previous two days' excursions. We ended up finding the National Naval Aviation Museum in Pensacola, FL, home base for the Blue Angels. Plan in hand, we did a little indoor swimming in a pool that Quin had identified as one that he wanted to swim in - it had a Fishy slide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple hours of indoor swimming and a little lunch, we headed down the coast first to Yogurt+, a little shop with 24 different flavors of yogurt and 100+ toppings to put on it - you paid by the ounce! We escaped with spending only $14 while the Zieglers suffered a $25 bill for their sweet tooths!&lt;br /&gt;Yogurt in our bellies, we did the 30 minute drive to Pensacola and visited the museum, a wonderful exhibit on Florida's panhandle. It had many full size planes and jets, historical instruction, flight simulators, food, shows - and it was all free! Well, admission was free, but you had to pay for things like the simulator. We cheaped out and denied our children any for-pay activities, but ended up spending about 2 hours at the museum. The most impressive thing to me was the space exhibit. Also, the fact that they had no plane in there that was designed after 1970, and they were pretty cool, meaning that the things that we have out there today must be pretty damn impressive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flight museum behind us, we went back to our room early and rested. It was wonderful - we just chilled, nothing to do, and were quiet for about 2 hours. Quin watched the now broken iPad which still functions (I'm writing this entry on it) while Ethan, Jenny, and I watched a George Clooney show on HBO that we got sucked into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had the group over for pizza and fresh shrimp that evening. The Zieglers also bought some boiled peanuts, something we'd seen all over the place down there and wanted to try - they weren't good... But the shrimp they bought was wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People had been vacationed out by then, so everybody left by 10:00 and we settled down for our last rest in our drug dealer condo. Through the course of the evening, Tim, Dan, and I invented several new sayings including an Alabama Cruise Missile (crude) and "Drunk as an Alabama Kindergarten Teacher."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Thursday, April 4, 2013 - Heading Home&lt;/h2&gt;Thursday - check-out day. It wasn't raining, but it was overcast and kind of cool, so we decided we would forego any Orange Beach activities for the day and get a head start on our drive. But first, we had one last stop planned at Alligator Alley, an alligator farm on the way. We spent about 90 minutes at the farm, during which time we saw hundreds of alligators of different ages. At 11:00 AM they fed the alligators, although it was relatively cool, and alligators don't need to eat very much anyway, so we were only able to see three that took up the offer of some fresh wild pork. The rest of the time we spent going through the swamp and feeding what looked and smelled like dog food to more alligators back there. Quin and Ethan were also able to hold an alligator - Ethan even kissed one, though he destroyed the picture evidence that we had taken...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that, the long haul home. Traffic was minimal, so we made good time. To pass the time, they boys traded turns picking a movie for the van's entertainment system while Jenny and I listened to audio books that we borrowed from the library. We tried one called "The Last Centurion" by John Ringo. After about 4 hours of it, neither of us could take it any longer. It started as a promising end of world, contagion type of fiction, but devolved quickly into a liberal bashing vehicle... It's rare anymore that I give up on a book, but we just couldn't do it any more...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We finally made it to Nashville later in the evening, about 8:30. We wanted to stay north of the city so as not to encounter rush hour traffic in the morning. It must be a hopping place to do business, however, as the first three hotels we tried were full. I take it back, one had a double queen smoking room, which we declined. The last place we tried directed us to the Magnuson Hotel about a mile away which used to be the Baymont Suites. They had just faxed that they had 12 non-smoking rooms available. Score!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We drove in, and it didn't look like it used to be a Baymont Inn. My unofficial rule for the trip was no hotels without interior hallways. This had exterior hallways, but we were tired, we had to get personal with the bathroom, and we were out of options, so we bit the bullet and checked in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At $90 a night, I guess I expected more. First, the door keycard did not work. The hotel attendant let us in with the master key and said the manager would be by later to fix the lock (they never fixed it). Next, the room smelled like they had just declared it non-smoking the week prior. There were stains on the carpet, the curtains were ripped, and the smell was almost unbearable! But, we were out of options - it had 2 beds and a working toilet - at least we thought it was working! After a thorough working over, I attempted to flush it, and it filled up to the top, and then some! It was pretty gross... I found the manager who gave me a plunger and some rags - I cleaned up the mess the best I could and passed out amidst the loud complaints of Jenny and Ethan that it smelled too bad to sleep!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Friday, April 5, 2013 - The Final Stretch&lt;/h2&gt;Having survived the room, and sleeping in until almost 8:00 to boot (I have no idea how I'm going to get back into a regular sleeping schedule - I'm used to 9+ hours a night at this point), we eagerly packed up and got out of the Magnuson Hotel and took our breakfast at the Waffle House, our last bucket list item of southern cuisine. I compare it to a George Webbs, but it hit the spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had a little over 8 hours to go to get home, so we decided a stop at a different cave in southern Kentucky wouldn't be altogether bad. We had heard about Lost River Cave in Bowling Green, KY, so decided to stop there. Once there we had about an hour before our tour started, so we walked the grounds to find several "holes," or places where the underground river surfaced. It was nice to stretch our legs. The tour was very interesting as well. This cave was, at times, used by both the Confederate and Union armys, was used as a mill, a night club, a garbage dump, and was finally rescued by a group of liberal tree huggers (sorry, flashbacks from yesterday's audio-book) in 1998 where they cleaned it up and started doing tours. It reminded me a lot of Spook Cave near where my parents grew up in eastern Iowa, and was a nice diversion for the rest of the trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the day went by uneventfully. Our stop in Kentucky enabled us to miss rush hour traffic in Chicago, though we had to endure it in Indianapolis, a fair trade. We passed the time by listening to our last book, Silverfin, a young James Bond book intended for 10-14 year olds, but Jenny and I enjoyed it quite a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We finally arrived home around 9:30, seeing our only traffic of the return voyage barely 20 miles away in Milwaukee! The whole family was excited to sleep in our own beds, though we missed Heinz - he didn't make it back from his vacation until the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div id="blogsy_footer" style="clear: both; font-size: small; text-align: right;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogsyapp.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="Posted with Blogsy" height="20" src="http://blogsyapp.com/images/blogsy_footer_icon.png" style="margin-right: 5px; vertical-align: middle;" width="20" /&gt;Posted with Blogsy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/4771877353635398890/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=4771877353635398890' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/4771877353635398890'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/4771877353635398890'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2013/04/sweet-vacation-alabama.html' title='Sweet Vacation - Alabama'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-2046166189923010281</id><published>2013-02-26T20:46:00.003-06:00</published><updated>2013-02-26T20:47:09.859-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Late February Update</title><content type='html'>&lt;b&gt;"He's On Fire!"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was in college, one of my favorite games on the Sega Genesis was NBA Jam. It was great. You could crank out a game in 15 minutes, everybody could play, and best of all, most of the time, I would win. A couple of weekends ago I got nostalgic. Ethan has all sorts of time to play all these complicated games. I want nothing more than to do that, but have other priorities than an 11 year old boy does (getting old sucks). I figured, though, that I could still play NBA Jam - it fits into my schedule, it's family friendly, and it is cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.ea.com/nba-jam-on-fire/videos/exclusive-nba-jam-on-fire-edition-1st-look&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought it - for the family. I have a hard time determining whether it was a good decision or a bad one. On the bright side, Quin and I play at least 2 games a day. He is all over it! He loves the San Antonio Spurs, has a number of special moves that I only marvel at, and really gets into it. I like to think it's teaching him to read large numbers as well. Often times when he's playing himself, he will call out and ask if he's winning. I'll ask what the scores are, and he'll say "I have a four and a two and they have a three and a seven." He also loves to get "on fire" - whenever he does so, he implores me to "feed him all the rock." On the dark side, however, he is a little too attached to it sometimes. Whenever he and Ethan play, fighting ensues. Also, if he wants to play and we make him stop, there is a meltdown of epic proportions. In the end, it's something that the boys and I can do together, even if it is rotting all of our brains...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Getting Older&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Jenny and I had a cold dose of reality about a week or two ago when we realized that we were no longer the ones with the best sense of pop-culture in the house. In fact, we have become squares (I think it's probably square to say that, even)! It really hit home when we were in the car going to the grocery store. Jenny was in the store getting something and the kids and I were sitting in the car waiting for her, listening to the radio. A song I had not heard came on, and after listening to a few seconds Ethan told me to crank it - which I did. It's a new, somewhat inappropriate song by a guy called Macklemore called Thrift Shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;object class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="http://1.gvt0.com/vi/ktCWU6R-CNk/0.jpg" height="266" width="320"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/ktCWU6R-CNk&amp;fs=1&amp;source=uds" /&gt;&lt;param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /&gt;&lt;embed width="320" height="266"  src="http://www.youtube.com/v/ktCWU6R-CNk&amp;fs=1&amp;source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's a song that's been out for a long time, and I had never heard of it. Ethan found out about it from a guy at school. I have to say, I think it's pretty catchy. We all sing it now, even though I'm sure it's already run its course on the "cool scene."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing the kids have shown me that is cool is our new family friendly obsession, The Aquabats Supershow. This is one just for the boys and I. It's a Saturday morning cartoon style show about a rock band that goes around saving the world, but they do it somewhat poorly and often by mistake. Ethan and Quin found it on Netflix and proceeded to watch all 13 episodes at least twice, many of them three or more times! It touched my heart when both Ethan and Quin got &lt;i&gt;really excited&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;when Weird Al Yankovic made a cameo appearance in two of the episodes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;object class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="http://3.gvt0.com/vi/3NXrAreJyy8/0.jpg" height="266" width="320"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/3NXrAreJyy8&amp;fs=1&amp;source=uds" /&gt;&lt;param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /&gt;&lt;embed width="320" height="266"  src="http://www.youtube.com/v/3NXrAreJyy8&amp;fs=1&amp;source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Naughty Word Cold&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Lastly, I'm going to try to coin a new phrase. It's really Quin's phrase, but I'm going to try to socialize it around and see if it catches on, because it's a good phrase. The other night we were leaving the YMCA after swimming lessons and it was &lt;i&gt;windy&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;and &lt;i&gt;cold&lt;/i&gt;. I shivered and stated, "wow, it's &lt;i&gt;stupid&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;cold out here, isn't it?" Well, Quin likes nothing better than when Jenny or I say something deemed as a naughty word, and generally repeats it incessantly for awhile. This was no different, but he quickly went through the progression of, "yeah, it is &lt;i&gt;stupid&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;cold. It's &lt;i&gt;idiot &lt;/i&gt;cold! It's &lt;i&gt;all the naughty words cold, &lt;/i&gt;isn't it dad!!!"</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/2046166189923010281/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=2046166189923010281' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/2046166189923010281'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/2046166189923010281'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2013/02/hes-on-fire-when-i-was-in-college-one.html' title='Late February Update'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.gvt0.com/vi/ktCWU6R-CNk/0.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-2841420897766445435</id><published>2013-02-08T08:56:00.004-06:00</published><updated>2013-02-08T08:56:45.972-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Four Eyes!</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;Check out four eyes!!!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mM6Rp1_z-EA/URURO35uGlI/AAAAAAAACd8/2YEHZclLe7s/s1600/EthanGlasses.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mM6Rp1_z-EA/URURO35uGlI/AAAAAAAACd8/2YEHZclLe7s/s320/EthanGlasses.jpeg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ethan has finally succumb to the fates of his genes, or I suppose since we're (yes, that was intentional) learning about heredity in science right now, the alleles that he's been gifted from Jenny and I, and has gotten glasses. His prescription is very mild - he only needs them for class, pretty much, not for sports or basically anything else. But it has begun. Later this year we will probably be putting him in braces (for his teeth, not his legs). Get in line, ladies!!!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Actually, all in all I think he's pretty lucky. I was 6 when I got glasses, and I needed them all the time. He's almost 12 and has just a mild prescription, so it looks like he will be lucky and have Jenny's weak eyes rather than mine (thanks, mom). Of course, that comes with Jenny's bad teeth, too (not my good ones - thanks, mom!).&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/2841420897766445435/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=2841420897766445435' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/2841420897766445435'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/2841420897766445435'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2013/02/four-eyes.html' title='Four Eyes!'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mM6Rp1_z-EA/URURO35uGlI/AAAAAAAACd8/2YEHZclLe7s/s72-c/EthanGlasses.jpeg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-7208115123110782507</id><published>2013-01-13T20:49:00.001-06:00</published><updated>2013-01-13T20:49:18.406-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>'Cause I like to party...</title><content type='html'>I have a running joke with the boys. Any time they ask me a question that begs me to define reasons for behavior, I like to answer, "'cause I like to party." It's a brilliant quote from Talladega Nights - if you're not familiar, check it out here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;object width="320" height="266" class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="http://1.gvt0.com/vi/SS_OVZtVa4E/0.jpg"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/SS_OVZtVa4E&amp;fs=1&amp;source=uds" /&gt;&lt;param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /&gt;&lt;embed width="320" height="266"  src="http://www.youtube.com/v/SS_OVZtVa4E&amp;fs=1&amp;source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, like most things I'd prefer they didn't, both boys have started using it in daily conversations, with improving timing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week, Quin was in the bathroom at school when a bunch of 8th grade boys walked in. In their conversation with Quin, one of them asked him why he was so cute. He calmly and immediately replied, "'cause I like to party!" Like I said, the timing is improving...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday was my 40th birthday. While I don't really believe in New Year's resolutions, I do sort of believe in birthday resolutions. If you were to ask me why, I would of course respond, "'cause I like to party." Anyway, I have some more things to post, and I will, and more often, I hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very quickly, I wanted to shout out to my brothers who convened on chilly Oconomowoc from parts throughout the midwest to celebrate my passage into the final year of my 4th decade. It was nice to see all of the friends and neighbors that were able to celebrate with me on the celebration of the day of my birth, but it was especially special to have my siblings there with me. Thanks boys, and your partners in crime as well!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/7208115123110782507/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=7208115123110782507' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/7208115123110782507'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/7208115123110782507'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2013/01/cause-i-like-to-party.html' title='&apos;Cause I like to party...'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.gvt0.com/vi/SS_OVZtVa4E/0.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-4863134137849213622</id><published>2013-01-06T18:40:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2013-01-06T18:40:19.074-06:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Quick Updates</title><content type='html'>Quin's stretches&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toronto phone call - pless 2.

Jenny and I have started pursuing another adoption, this time an international one through the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire). So far much has been the same as last time around - filling out paperwork, background checks, talking about my feelings - fun stuff. We're getting to the point where we will be having a social worker come to the house to interview us, so we were explaining to Quinton what we were doing. Jenny explained it to him that he was going to have a new brother. He looked very confused and concerned and asked her, "is Ethan leaving?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Guest Author&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Jenny's and my parents both came down to attend Ethan and Quin's Grandparent's day at their school. It's sort of a special year since both Ethan and Quin are in school along with their cousins, Jenny's sister's boys. Since Quin and their youngest are in the same class, and Ethan and their oldest are in separate classes (three classes in all), Ethan hatched a plan where the Kelchen boys could have their other grandparents be with the eldest Kelchen boy, Jenny's parents could hang out with the youngest Kelchen and Quinton, then my parents could hang out with Ethan. A fool proof plan if I've ever heard one! Well, that wasn't how things ultimately panned out...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, while my parents were down, they were helping the boys get ready for school or something. My dad recounts the conversation better than I could, so here I present my first ever guest auther - my dad, Glen Grady:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;Last Tuesday morning, while we were getting ready for the Grandparents Day Mass at your house, Quinn was looking for his DSI- whatever that is. I was helping him look. We went down in the basement to the laundry room to look- when we were down there someone flushed the toilet and I pointed to the pipe and told him that that was where the water from the toilet and bath tub drained out- he looked at the furnace and saw the gas line and asked if that was the same thing- I told him that that was where the gas came in to burn in the furnace. He looked thoughtfully at me and said- you know Grandpa, if you have a fire in the house you are suppose to get on your hands and knees and crawl out of the house and not get up until someone tells you to. I asked him if he learned that at school- he said, "yes, a policeman came and told them that- and he didn't say "you're under arrest." I think big brother has been talking to our little Quin.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;Quinton the Worker&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Last weekend, Jenny and I ran in our first half marathon together. Let me explain - we've both run them before, but never at the same time, and never together. Probably not that important... Anyway, my parents were again in town to watch Ethan and Quin while we punished ourselves on the cold highways of Lake Mills. When we got home, my mom recounted the story where Quin had hung his own poster. When she told me about it, I immediately thought back to a couple of nights before when an Angry Birds poster showed up on his bed one night as I was tucking him in. I remember him telling me that he wanted to hang it up, and he clearly pointed to the exact spot on the wall where he was going to put it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As mom recounts the story, Quin got out his toolbox that his other grandparents had gotten him earlier, complete with a plastic hammer, plastic wrench, and plastic, but mechanized drill. Mom said that he somehow came up with some nails (I assume from some other picture he took down from elsewhere in his room), then sized up the wall, took his plastic hammer, and somehow managed to hang the poster up all by himself. When he finally showed up while mom was relating the story, he got very excited and immediately took me upstairs to show me his handywork. I must admit, I was impressed - he did a very good job, and it was only slightly crooked. He then proudly told me that he was a "worker" and that was what he wanted to be when he grows up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Halloween 2012&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;As I've no doubt written before, Ethan's favorite time of year is Halloween. November 1st marks the first day of planning for the next Halloween, typically. He helps everybody plan out their costumes. Quin rarely has to pick out his own costume as his big brother will tell him exactly what he should be (he was Spiderman this year, incidentally). In the past, Ethan has been your typical popular character - Spiderman, The Hulk, A Clone Trooper (twice), Darth Maul (which was actually very cool), but each year his excitement was clearly at a much higher level than mine was with regards to his costume. That was until this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plan started hatching sometime in early to mid September. Ethan must have discussed his plan with my mother, because one day when they came to visit us, she showed up with our old&amp;nbsp;accordion. At the time I wasn't sure what it was for - I assumed it was part of her sneaky plot to trick her grandchildren into taking all of her old stuff into my house so she could clean her attic. But this was for some grander vision. When Ethan saw what it was, he let me in on the plan - he was going to be Weird Al. More specifically, he was going to be a UHF era Weird Al.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fc/UHFposter.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fc/UHFposter.jpg" width="208" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;Most of you that know me are aware that I am a very big Weird Al fan. Jenny has often complained that she has been to more Weird Al concerts than she has been to all other artists' concerts combined. Well, that fandom has clearly rubbed off on my oldest, who has also now been to a concert, has memorized large chunks of his only feature film (UHF), and has now decided that he was going to dress as him for Halloween.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;He meticulously planned out each phase of the costume. Granted, it wasn't that hard. With the accordion secured, all he needed was a wig, some glasses, a fake mustache, and a Hawaiian shirt. After a trip to the costume store and Goodwill, his raw materials were assembled, and he was ready. When Halloween night finally came, he got into his costume, and I think I may have actually cried a little bit when I saw him. Honestly, I think he could one day be elected President of the United States and I wouldn't be prouder than I was of him at that moment.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;We took a series of pictures as we typically do. One of the photos turned out well enough that I sent it to Al himself. In this day of social networks, it's easy to get something out there and potentially in front of that individual. Al has literally hundreds of thousands of Twitter followers, so I can only imagine the noise that he must get on that account, but somehow, some way, he picked Ethan out of the crowd and included him in his series of "Best Costumes of 2012."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://d3j5vwomefv46c.cloudfront.net/photos/full/680920023.jpg?key=30723072&amp;amp;Expires=1352346121&amp;amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIYVGSUJFNRFZBBTA&amp;amp;Signature=hv5s43Uxur4lurEK7ffGCQXBBXV5mEF-Ciy9BxoMbgMvrN5lXuqiUUyIvpBDgdwTrK-neWsNoSctbKjbb~Qg0wQ4M6eIfEsva1rZiEw3ZJR06wg3RdaLxBJiXjdIyyJkCcENEdMf~rDnaHX6RWao~1f3TTHrLZ3pS3ppTmJrJWE_" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://d3j5vwomefv46c.cloudfront.net/photos/full/680920023.jpg?key=30723072&amp;amp;Expires=1352346121&amp;amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIYVGSUJFNRFZBBTA&amp;amp;Signature=hv5s43Uxur4lurEK7ffGCQXBBXV5mEF-Ciy9BxoMbgMvrN5lXuqiUUyIvpBDgdwTrK-neWsNoSctbKjbb~Qg0wQ4M6eIfEsva1rZiEw3ZJR06wg3RdaLxBJiXjdIyyJkCcENEdMf~rDnaHX6RWao~1f3TTHrLZ3pS3ppTmJrJWE_" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;Recognize the handsome devil in the lower left?

It' hard to really comprehend all that has gone on in the humble Milwaukee Grady household since last I wrote on this 'blog, but I suppose I'll try to capture it here for your amusement, or at the least, for you to practice your proof reading skills!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The great family vacation!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h4&gt;We took a year off last year from what had become an annual tradition, a trip up north. This year we again booked a cabin on a lake in northern Wisconsin for a week. Along with several other families, we took over Kafka's Resort on Lake George near Rhinelander. Kafka's was a very nice place, if not a little on the "quaint" side, with a very stodgy owner who I can't believe actually managed to rent out his place to anybody with kids. Kafka seemed to like things to operate in a particular way, and if you didn't see eye to eye with him, he figured you were trying to put him out of business, and he let you know it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, Old Man Kafka aside, it was a very nice week with beautiful weather and plenty of outdoor activities for the kids to partake in where they would normally be watching movies or playing video games. We spent the days fishing, playing in the sand, swimming, playing on the playground, and different variations of those repeated throughout the week. The smaller kids (there were 12 total kids in our group) launched a fish hatchery business - Ethan and Quinton didn't really participate, though Quin did his best to keep them stocked with fish and did enjoy playing with the fish in the "hatchery."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quin has actually proven himself to be quite the fisherman. He was up early most days fishing with whoever would help him untangle his Spiderman fishing pole's line and help him bait his hook. By the end of the week he was baiting his own hook and taking fish off himself. He and I went out on the boat with one of the other guys in our group one day, and Quin was able to occupy himself fishing the entire 90 minutes we were out there - and if you know Quin, that is quite a feat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6QcaaM-tkFM/UE_yb-mV9HI/AAAAAAAACQY/78HM3FPrnOk/s1600/DSC_8562.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="213" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6QcaaM-tkFM/UE_yb-mV9HI/AAAAAAAACQY/78HM3FPrnOk/s320/DSC_8562.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethan had quite a time doing water sports while up there. He had successfully started skiing behind our friend's boat this summer, but while in Rhinelander he became quite adept at it, mastering getting outside the wake and even the smooth dismount to come to a gentle stop in the shallow water so he didn't have to swim back to the launching point. He really likes skiing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0wkQDTCBeew/UE_yc4rv0EI/AAAAAAAACQo/rPbiavTlvW8/s1600/DSC_8779.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="213" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0wkQDTCBeew/UE_yc4rv0EI/AAAAAAAACQo/rPbiavTlvW8/s320/DSC_8779.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CfyHfuWj3pE/UE_ycbwvWaI/AAAAAAAACQg/TYVe0twr5IE/s1600/DSC_8777.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="213" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CfyHfuWj3pE/UE_ycbwvWaI/AAAAAAAACQg/TYVe0twr5IE/s320/DSC_8777.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We did have one day that was a bit on the rainy side, so Quin, Ethan, Jacob (a friend's boy) and I went on a Rhinelander Hodag hunt. The boys and I tried to capture as many Hodags on our cameras as we could. In 2 hours time, we located at least a dozen throughout town. Quite the adventure!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_o4Gqooh2oU/UE_ydvEAUvI/AAAAAAAACQw/ngW-DAiJHwE/s1600/DSC_8860.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="213" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_o4Gqooh2oU/UE_ydvEAUvI/AAAAAAAACQw/ngW-DAiJHwE/s320/DSC_8860.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Circus&lt;/h4&gt;Quinton has been a big fan of Curious George for many months now. The wonder that is Netflix Streaming gives him the opportunity to watch many hours of this show per day, episode after episode. I think part of the reason he enjoys the show is because George shows him things that he can try to be even naughtier than he is now! That aside, he was really excited when George went to the circus. For the weeks following that episode he was begging and pleading for us to take him to the Circus. "We never go to the circus," was his battle cry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few weeks ago, Jenny actually located a circus about 60 miles from our home in Racine. It came across on a Groupon, so we got admission for 4 and 2 pizzas for $35. We didn't really think it was a great deal, but when we got there we were faced with a hefty dose of sticker shock. Normal admission to the circus was $38 per adult! I doubt anybody actually paid that due to different deals going on around town, but other prices were right in line with the admission. For example, you could go for a 2 minute pony ride for $6 or a camel ride for $12. A little cup of lemonade to wash down your prepaid pizza ran $6 a piece!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, the circus was definitely fun. Both of the kids had their favorite parts, and the performers were pretty good for a traveling circus in today's day and age! Quin really enjoyed the "clown" who did an act where he was dancing to a song that was playing on his boom box. Another circus official would come out, turn off the boom box, and in Broken English tell the clown, "No Music!" The clown would turn to the crowd who would boo him, the official would turn around and plead his case, then walk away, at which time the clown turned the boom box back on. Quin was in stitches at the end when the circus official put the boom box in a garbage can and put the cover on to stifle the music, only to have the clown take the cover off of the garbage can and have the music play again. Like I said, big fan of Curious George...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jenny and I had a favorite part as well. Just prior to intermission, the ring announcer addressed the crowd to inform them that during intermission, several rarities would be available in the ring for people to take their picture. On one side of the ring was a real lemur from Madagascar. In the other side of the ring was a 7 foot python! Then, in the middle of the ring was everybody's favorite Transformer, Optimus Prime! When they announced this, we looked up to see a 6'5" Eastern European guy come walking out in what can only be described as a kid's Halloween costume - in fact, Ethan actually has this costume - complete with flimsy plastic mask! He then proceeded to dance by himself in the middle of the ring while the diapered lemur and snake took pictures with a steady stream of patrons. Our best guess is that this is some sort of circus hazing where the new guy has to dress up as Optimus prime, kind of like Happy Gilmore was enticed to stand on the 18th green at 9:00...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Ethan's first driving lesson&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;We still have my dad's old truck sitting around in our driveway. I insure it but don't license it, and pretty much just use it to move things around the yard - sort of like a big wheelbarrow. Over the summer we removed a bunch of branches from various trees around the yard and had them stacked up in the back of the yard. A couple of weekends ago we were going to pick up the branches in the truck and drive them to Jenny's sister's house who was going to be renting a wood chipper for the day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;As I was preparing the truck to go pick up the branches, Quin asked if he could ride in the back, to which I agreed immediately. Quickly afterwards, Ethan asked me if he could drive. I hesitated, but then said OK, what's the worst thing that could happen, right? I lined the truck up pointing toward the back yard, put it in park, then slid over to allow Ethan to drive it to the back. He put it in gear, then started rolling right toward the house. I started chanting, "brake, brake!" to which he responded, "I am!!!" I quickly flipped the truck to park, it rolled about 10 more feet right into our front lamp pole, bending it to a 45 degree angle, then finally came to rest. Ethan was frazzled, I was yelling, so I told him to move over and I would drive it - sure enough, no brakes! I suppose it wouldn't have been so bad if our neighbor hadn't been outside watching the whole thing unfold! Just call us the Oconomowoc Hillbillies, I suppose.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First day of school&lt;/h4&gt;Last Tuesday was the first day of school. Ethan's first day in 6th grade and Quinton's first day in K4. Quinton was, and still is, very excited to ride on the bus, and has seemed to take to school quite well. I was a little worried that Quin would be a handful at school. He seems like quite a handful at home! On the first day he went in, I was at work when I received a call on my cell phone from a 262 number that I didn't recognize. My mind immediately told me that Quin was already in the principal's office! Well, it turned out not to be the case and Quin's been good enough not to warrant a call home yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ENPTOGlnSls/UE_yePw1BnI/AAAAAAAACQ4/GJMowO9v8-4/s1600/DSC_8966.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ENPTOGlnSls/UE_yePw1BnI/AAAAAAAACQ4/GJMowO9v8-4/s320/DSC_8966.jpg" width="213" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I suppose we did get a call home the other day. Quin got off the bus and told Jenny that he had sat in some "pokey grass" at school and that he cried. Later in the evening we got a call from his teacher telling us that she thinks he was bit by a bee on the playground and was very upset about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He seems to be doing pretty well in school. Last week as I was coaching Ethan's soccer practice, Jenny dropped Quin off for the last 20 minutes of practice so she could meet up with somebody. We were scrimmaging at the time, so I was walking up and down the sideline with my clipboard and practice cheat sheet with me. He asked if he could draw me a picture, so I gave him the practice sheet and pen. What he drew is classic Quinton - a big circle person with stick hands and feet and a circle head. This particular person was kicking a soccer ball. The best part of this piece was that Quinton signed it for me. His name's not perfect on it, but it's definitely Quinton, and he didn't even have anything to copy it or anything. Jenny is bragging that he's been in school only a week and has already mastered the letter Q and is obsessed with soccer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1Mho2cSfnsc/UE_1CnSYa6I/AAAAAAAACRY/d4T0HyjUxyc/s1600/quinPic.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1Mho2cSfnsc/UE_1CnSYa6I/AAAAAAAACRY/d4T0HyjUxyc/s400/quinPic.png" width="308" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Soccer Gradys&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;I'm not entirely sure how it happened, but soccer has torn through our house as a family pass time. I was hornswoggled into coaching Ethan's U12 rec team. Ethan is doing very well this year and has already scored 3 goals in our first game of the season, a game his team won 12-0. Quinton has started playing U6 ball, which consists of a 30 minute practice followed by a 30 minute game each Saturday. This last Saturday was Quin's first session and he was VERY excited. As soon as he woke up at 6:30 he was asking when we were going to soccer. He continued to ask when we were going until we got there at 10:00. In fact, as we were driving there, he frequently asked us if we were going the right way, and when we would stop at a stop sign he would ask why we weren't going to soccer... He had a great game! He listened very well to his coach and even scored 2 goals, one for each team!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OqYDpBaH_V0/UE_ye-R48zI/AAAAAAAACRA/k_zzWja9vrY/s1600/DSC_8984.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="213" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OqYDpBaH_V0/UE_ye-R48zI/AAAAAAAACRA/k_zzWja9vrY/s320/DSC_8984.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bTNl3PPHYKY/UE_yfXpb_kI/AAAAAAAACRI/JG9ZHp8Py8U/s1600/DSC_8986.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="213" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bTNl3PPHYKY/UE_yfXpb_kI/AAAAAAAACRI/JG9ZHp8Py8U/s320/DSC_8986.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/7071622929844088851/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=7071622929844088851' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/7071622929844088851'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/7071622929844088851'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2012/09/time-flies-stuff-happens-and-my-writing.html' title=''/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6QcaaM-tkFM/UE_yb-mV9HI/AAAAAAAACQY/78HM3FPrnOk/s72-c/DSC_8562.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-891601933578401574</id><published>2012-08-05T20:41:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2012-08-05T20:41:33.467-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Ethan'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Fitness'/><title type='text'>My Little Triathetes</title><content type='html'>Last weekend was the annual "Tri-ing for Children's Triathlon," a weekend long set of triathlons to benefit Children's Hospital here in town. Jenny and I were both signed up to do the sprint triathlon, a 1/4 mile swim, 15 mile bike, then 3.1 mile run. We've done it a few years in a row now, so that's not what I'm writing about - this year we decided to let our kids participate in the kid's event on the Saturday prior to the adult races.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For Quin this was his first triathlon. He was to swim 25 yards, bike 1/4 mile, then run 0.1 mile to the finish. Even though he'd never done one before, we were pretty confident that he would do well - he's one of the only 4 year olds I know that is on 2 wheels versus training wheels, and he's pretty fast. His race started out well - they started them every 3 seconds until all of them were in the water, and they were chip timed. He passed the girl in front of him in the "swim," which was 25 yards in waist deep water - all the kids I saw walked it, and Quin was no exception. From there, he ran to transition where I helped him putting on a shirt, shoes, and socks - what we would soon realize was a disastrous mistake. As soon as we got his shoes and socks on, he was off on the bike - calling it 1/4 mile was very generous - it was a single lap around a quite small parking lot. Quin was out and back in only a few seconds. From there, he parked the bike and took off on the 0.1 mile run. When it was all over, Quin placed 9th overall at 6 minutes 40 seconds. We're pretty sure if we had just put Crocs on him instead of bothering with shoes and socks, he could have contended! Oh well, next year he'll be in the next, tougher division, so the strategy will have to be learned anew.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After Quin was done with his race it was hurry up and wait for Ethan. He was competing in the 11-14 year old division, the oldest kids at the triathlon. He stood dutifully on the beach watching wave after wave of 5-11 year olds swim their lap in the waist deep water then head off to the bike. Though he claimed not to be nervous, he was getting impatient with waiting and exclaimed, "I just want this to be over." As they went through the different age groups, they continued to move the swimming area buoy further and further apart, until they ran out of room in the swimming area. I started wondering aloud with Ethan how they were going to accommodate his 200 yard swim in that small area, but assured him he would be able to touch throughout the entirety of the swim. As they finally got to Ethan's division, the announced how the legs would be run. They would swim to the far buoy in the swimming area, then out of the swimming area to some of the adult buoys for Sunday's race! What!??! They were sending him out past the weeds where he couldn't touch!!?!?! This was crazy... Well, Jenny and I kind of crapped ourselves, but pulled it together. As calmly as I could, I told Jenny to just back off, knowing she would probably freak him out, and I went up to talk with Ethan. Casually I said to him, "Well, it looks like you are not going to be able touch the whole way." He looked at me with that "duh, dad" look on his face, paused dramatically, then said, "well, I suppose I'll just have to swim then." He convinced me, and he did just that - he swam the whole 200 yards, then got out on his 6 mile bike, and finished it off with a 1 mile run. He wasn't in great shape, and he wasn't anywhere near as good as some crazy good triathlete kids out there, but he finished it - it wasn't a big deal to him - he just doesn't freak out about those things like I do, I suppose, and I'm a little jealous.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ethan's "I'm just going to do it" attitude inspired me for my triathlon the next day. I'd like to say I ran it fast, but I didn't. Instead, I got the most sleep I've ever had the night before a triathlon and ran a very comfortable race. Because if Ethan can do it, so can I!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: none;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-O7Us5tUmcBs/UB8gbs3EufI/AAAAAAAACOs/QkxFNeQBsRU/s1024/Photo%252520Jul%25252028%25252C%2525202012%2525208%25253A07%252520AM.jpg" target="_blank" style=""&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-O7Us5tUmcBs/UB8gbs3EufI/AAAAAAAACOs/QkxFNeQBsRU/s500/Photo%252520Jul%25252028%25252C%2525202012%2525208%25253A07%252520AM.jpg" id="blogsy-1344217363381.0828" class="alignnone" alt="" width="500" height="374"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: none;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-kdaTrrJHm58/UB8geVgj-MI/AAAAAAAACO0/KZgAkq041f8/s1024/Photo%252520Jul%25252028%25252C%2525202012%2525209%25253A21%252520AM.jpg" target="_blank" style=""&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-kdaTrrJHm58/UB8geVgj-MI/AAAAAAAACO0/KZgAkq041f8/s500/Photo%252520Jul%25252028%25252C%2525202012%2525209%25253A21%252520AM.jpg" id="blogsy-1344217363474.2815" class="alignnone" alt="" width="500" height="374"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: none;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-g2sPBxUT8kw/UB8ghF2uC2I/AAAAAAAACO8/lmFZybNV4vM/s1024/Photo%252520Jul%25252028%25252C%2525202012%2525209%25253A52%252520AM.jpg" target="_blank" style=""&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-g2sPBxUT8kw/UB8ghF2uC2I/AAAAAAAACO8/lmFZybNV4vM/s500/Photo%252520Jul%25252028%25252C%2525202012%2525209%25253A52%252520AM.jpg" id="blogsy-1344217363405.2944" class="alignnone" alt="" width="500" height="374"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: right; font-size: small; clear: both;" id="blogsy_footer"&gt;&lt;a href="http://blogsyapp.com" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img src="http://blogsyapp.com/images/blogsy_footer_icon.png" alt="Posted with Blogsy" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 5px;" width="20" height="20" /&gt;Posted with Blogsy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/891601933578401574/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=891601933578401574' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/891601933578401574'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/891601933578401574'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2012/08/my-little-triathetes.html' title='My Little Triathetes'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-O7Us5tUmcBs/UB8gbs3EufI/AAAAAAAACOs/QkxFNeQBsRU/s72-c/Photo%252520Jul%25252028%25252C%2525202012%2525208%25253A07%252520AM.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-9159920464997313173</id><published>2012-06-25T21:53:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2012-06-25T21:53:06.644-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='TMI'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Ethan'/><title type='text'>Little Quinny</title><content type='html'>Have you ever heard the "Little Johnny" jokes? For several reasons, I have a feeling that they might one day be replaced by "Little Quinny" jokes. Here's an example of one - Little Johnny was in class learning his ABCs. The teacher was asking the class to name something with each letter of the alphabet in order. Little Johnny raised his hand for each letter, but she kept skipping him thinking that he would say something bad, like "ass" for A and "butt" for B. Finally, she had gotten all the way to R. Little Johnny dutifully raised his hand while nobody else did. She figured, "what could he say that is naughty that starts with R?" So she called on Little Johnny. Little Johnny immediately said, "Rats!" "Oh, that's nice," the teacher said, relieved. "No, Rats, with big penises!" Little Johnny followed up immediately...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Well, I have my own version of Little Johnny in my house. We had some friends over for dinner. All of the adults had gathered outside while the kids gathered in the kitchen. One brave soul went in to check on her son, and came out a couple of minutes later laughing. She said that Quin was teaching the kids the alphabet. "A, B, C, D, E, F, penis..." She apparently kept it together long enough to get outside before she busted out laughing...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ethan has been showing off his entrepreneurial side again. He and a buddy were out exploring near a train station a few days back and they found what they are sure are chunks of coal. The two of them are convinced that they can sell it for big money on Ebay, only one of them needs an account. So he asked me, and I told him we'd talk about it later, and then left to go to a movie with Jenny. Before the movie we stopped for appetizers at a brewpub and I got a call on my cell phone - it was Ethan, using his iPod as a phone. I answered and he asked if it was OK if he signed up for an Ebay account - he was apparently at the screen where it said you had to ask your parents. So I told him no and that we would talk about it later... It's kind of funny how persistent he is on one hand, yet he's so afraid to break the rules that he insists on calling me even a few minutes after we had already discussed it - and still follows my directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/9159920464997313173/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=9159920464997313173' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/9159920464997313173'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/9159920464997313173'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2012/06/little-quinny.html' title='Little Quinny'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-8708241614021129166</id><published>2012-06-10T22:35:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2012-06-10T22:35:28.304-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><title type='text'>Quinny the Spy</title><content type='html'>Quin and I were at home together the other day - I can't remember why. Jenny and Ethan were out somewhere, I think to get Ethan a haircut. We opened the garage and heard something flying around in there. Before long, Quin had spotted the culprit - a bird had gotten itself stuck in the garage. He was having a hard time finding his way out, and Quin was enthralled! I went into the house and started putting things away from my day's work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quin came in a couple of minutes later and asked for some juice, which I gave him, and he took it outside with him to watch the bird some more. After awhile, Ethan came home, and Quin came inside and asked for something else to drink. I asked him where his juice was, but he didn't know. So I told him he had to find his other juice before I would give him another one. Well, he couldn't find it - and after awhile, I couldn't either. In fact, I was getting a little upset at him, and he could tell, so he told me, "I think the birdie took it." I rolled my eyes, thinking he was just messing with me and was hiding it. After a few minutes, we went outside to look in the garage together. Quin looked up and saw the bird, and said very sincerely, "he doesn't have it!" I'm pretty sure he really believed that the bird had taken it!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After looking for a few more minutes, Quin told me that we should call a spy to come and help us find it, because that's what spies do, "right dad?" I have no idea where he comes up with this stuff, but the whole exchange cracked me up...&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/8708241614021129166/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=8708241614021129166' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/8708241614021129166'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/8708241614021129166'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2012/06/quinny-spy.html' title='Quinny the Spy'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-8569605156660946420</id><published>2012-05-28T21:10:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2012-05-28T21:10:19.429-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Vacation'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Ethan'/><title type='text'>Happy Memorial Day!</title><content type='html'>We had the opportunity to travel to Spread Eagle, WI near Iron Mountain, MI for Memorial Day this year. A friend of ours works for a company that owns a "cabin" on a lake up there, which they allow their employees to rent by the week during the year. When say cabin, I mean a 5 bedroom, 4000 square foot, modern home that is situated on a lake up north. So we joined 3 other families up there for the weekend.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For some reason, the whole day leading up to our travel up there, Quin couldn't stop talking about going fishing! He kept asking when we were going to go fishing. The drive was over 4 hours to get up there, but he kept asking. Once we were up there, he did just that. Not the first day, but on Saturday he fished, and fished, and fished. He was completely slaying the fish around the pier. Each time he dropped his hook in the water a fish would bite. In fact, I didn't really get an opportunity to fish at all because Quin kept reeling them in so fast. When we were getting ready to leave this morning, he was still fishing, and just as we were about to put the fishing poles away, he cast one last time and caught a big bass, the biggest of the trip!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On Sunday morning, the kids, our friend Tim, and I were down on the pier emptying the fishing boat of the rain water that had collected the night prior. Quin and Ethan were messing around with some canoe paddles, and Quin of course dropped on in the lake, out of reach from anybody on the pier. Ethan declared that the only way to get it would be to swim after it! Being a reasonable adult, I told him to not do that and that I would get it with the canoe, which I started to do. Apparently Ethan took that as a challenge, obtained an inner-tube, then got in it, fully clothed, and raced me to the paddle. Meanwhile, Quin was sitting on a bench on the pier, which I told him he had to do until I retrieved the paddle, kind of a punishment. He saw Ethan in the water, and apparently was overcome with the notion of being in the water. The next thing I knew he was flying through the air, fleece jacket and all, into the water! Officially I was angry at him, but secretly I was laughing hysterically at both of them. Yeah, their clothes were all wet, but they sure were having a good time despite their old fuddy duddy of a dad!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/8569605156660946420/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=8569605156660946420' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/8569605156660946420'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/8569605156660946420'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2012/05/happy-memorial-day.html' title='Happy Memorial Day!'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-4366726093403345799</id><published>2012-05-13T21:53:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2012-05-13T21:53:39.005-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Happy Mother's Day</title><content type='html'>My boys really don't think much, normally, before a Hallmark Holiday like Mother's Day. Last night, however, Ethan asked me (discretely) what mom's favorite breakfast was. I told him that she liked an egg over easy with toast. He nodded, then said that he'd like to make that for her in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this morning, Quin (and I, I suppose) woke up a little after 6:00. He watched Garfield while I watched the inside of my eyelids for an hour more. Around 7:45, I heard Jenny stirring, watching TV in the bedroom. After another 15 minutes, I went upstairs to wake up my tweenager who had only 10 hours of sleep at that point, and told him it was time. He asked me what to do, and I told him. While Ethan was frying the egg, Quin made and buttered toast. Ethan got the egg just right on the first try, impressively! Quin then put a carnation in his teeth and carried the plate while Ethan poured some orange juice in a glass and delivered it to mom for mother's day! I have no idea how it tasted, but Jenny ate it all up, so either it tasted fine, or she is just a good mom - I suppose it could be both...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a nice day today - seasonably warm and sunny with no wind. Quin and I were outside mowing the lawn a little later in the morning. He was bored, so I told him he could wash bird droppings off the house with the hose (aren't I a nice dad!). While I was getting the hose ready, he was looking in the sky and told me, "the sun tickles your eyes." Well, in Quinglish he said, "the sun tickles you eyes." I had no idea how poetic my 4 year old was!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy mothers day to all (mothers)!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/4366726093403345799/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=4366726093403345799' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/4366726093403345799'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/4366726093403345799'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2012/05/happy-mothers-day.html' title='Happy Mother&apos;s Day'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-3474514350308802225</id><published>2012-04-02T07:02:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2012-04-02T07:02:56.681-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Westward Expansion</title><content type='html'>I had an interesting experience as a parent last night and had to share it with the world, because that's what we do in the day and age of over sharing... Ethan has a test in Social Studies today. They are covering early history of the United states, from Washington's presidency through the war of 1812. As an aside, I make a way better fifth grader as a 39 year old than I ever did as a 10 year old... That is to say that this information is way more interesting to me today than it ever was 30 years ago. So the way I quiz him is I go through and read the chapters while picking out what I think are key details of the chapters. To my delight, we were talking about Daniel Boone and the Westward Expansion, Louisiana Purchase, etc., and we got to a quote that is credited to DB himself when asked why he continued to move west until his dying day, which was (I'm paraphrasing), "I need some elbow room." That, of course, made me think back to Saturday morning cartoon interludes from our friends at School House Rock. Since I had my laptop sitting right next to me, I quickly searched for the video and was rewarded with the 3 minutes and 10 seconds of goodness that I remembered. I quickly brought it up and let Ethan watch it. I now share it with you for nostalgia's sake:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;object width="320" height="266" class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="http://2.gvt0.com/vi/5Ha11IunYN4/0.jpg"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/5Ha11IunYN4&amp;fs=1&amp;source=uds" /&gt;&lt;param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /&gt;&lt;embed width="320" height="266"  src="http://www.youtube.com/v/5Ha11IunYN4&amp;fs=1&amp;source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me it was one of those moments that I think I will remember for a long time. The perfect blend of experience and technology coming together at just the right time and place. Of course, I guess it all only matters if Ethan does well on the test - if he remembers the content of the cartoon and his chapter and translates it back to his studies. It also makes me wonder if, when Ethan is 39 years old, will he be able to somehow relate "Annoying Orange" to some important history lesson for his children?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;object width="320" height="266" class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="http://1.gvt0.com/vi/cL_qGMfbtAk/0.jpg"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/cL_qGMfbtAk&amp;fs=1&amp;source=uds" /&gt;&lt;param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /&gt;&lt;embed width="320" height="266"  src="http://www.youtube.com/v/cL_qGMfbtAk&amp;fs=1&amp;source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/3474514350308802225/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=3474514350308802225' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/3474514350308802225'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/3474514350308802225'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2012/04/westward-expansion.html' title='Westward Expansion'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.gvt0.com/vi/5Ha11IunYN4/0.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-1303245864482234892</id><published>2012-03-11T22:50:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2012-03-11T22:50:27.260-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Ethan'/><title type='text'>Potpourri</title><content type='html'>&lt;h1&gt;The Big Update&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, for the prerequisite apology. My wife and my mother both have scolded me for not having an update out here for going on 2 months now, so here is the big update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Quin Does Music&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last 2 months, Quin has put his musical skills on display. He enjoys listening to music on his CD player in his room - last night he told his babysitter all about the music player he had in his room with at least 10 CDs! He also told her that he had a really big bed. Something tells me that he is starting to develop his pickup lines early. Anyway, he loves listening to all kinds of music, but some of his favorites are "Sexy and I Know It" by LMFAO (he sings it "Sexxies and I Know It") and "Moves Like Jagger" by Marroon 5, which Quin sings "Moves like Quinton." His moves are not to be taken lightly. He very much enjoys doing "The Booty Dance" for us (sorry, I don't have a video), particularly when Ethan is showing us some of his moves. More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/wyx6JDQCslE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Quinton on Food&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quinny has become quite the food expert. He likes food - a lot. It takes quite a bit of food to support his ever growing body. He likes to tell me, "Dad, I'm growing bigger!" A recent trip to the doctor confirmed that statement to the tune of 45 inches tall and 45 pounds - his 4 year old checkup! I don't like to brag, but he's off the chart for height and at the 95th percentile on weight, though he is modestly at the 50th percentile on the weight per height metric. Anyway - food. Though I believe his favorite food continues to be spaghetti, a newcomer to the race is the corndog, which Quinton pronounces "Horndog!" I'm pretty sure it is among his favorites because of its ability to get large quantities of ketchup into his mouth. We were out with some friends a couple of weeks ago where Quin ordered a "horndog." Though he was the only one using the full bottle of ketchup at the table, by the end of the meal, over half of it was gone...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Quinton on Climbing&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quinton has swimming lessons on Tuesday nights - Ethan has lessons on Thursdays. Our YMCA is equipped with a rock climbing wall, complete with auto-belay systems and equipment for all ages to climb. The first week Quinton had lessons, we let Ethan climb the wall for his first time - well, his first time in awhile. He did pretty well, but Quinton was entranced. He wanted to try it, but we had to go. During Ethan's lesson on Thursday, Quinton got in trouble at school, so his punishment was no rock climbing (yes, meanest. parents. ever.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, finally, a week later, Quinton managed to be good enough at school and home that we were going to try rock climbing with him during Ethan's lesson. We walked up to get his equipment but were almost turned away as their policy had apparently only recently (within the last week) been changed to include 4 year olds in the eligible age group. So they strapped Quin up and put him on lane 5, the beginner's wall. It's still 40 feet high (I think), but the pegs are a little closer together and the wall doesn't vary in and out all that much like the more advanced walls do. His first try he made it up a few feet before he jettisoned from the wall and was gently let down by the auto-belay system. The next time he did about the same. I figured he would be ready to go by then, but he just walked right back up to the wall again and again, determined to climb. By his 4th try, he finally escaped the gravitational pull of the ground and climbed about half way up the wall. The lady that was helping him was stunned - I couldn't stop grinning. This 4 year old was laying waste to several teenagers attempting to climb at the same time. By the time he reached 15-20 feet, he again let go and gently fell to the floor - which I figured would be the end of it, but he went right back to the wall. A few more failed attempts and I convinced him to take a rest, but he was hooked, and had become somewhat of a local celebrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We went through one more session of this while Ethan was at his lesson and while Jenny ran upstairs, then I convinced him that we should go play in the family room where they have a cool tunnel toy and computer games. When Jenny came back from her run and Ethan was done with his lesson, I was relating the story to the two of them. At this point, the competitive juices were flowing through Ethan. He climbed well the week before, but had never "rung the bell" at the top of the wall, so he was going to climb. Quin wanted to climb again, too, and Jenny (kind of) wanted to see him do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, Ethan made it up to the top of several lanes as well as the very difficult rope ladder, for the first time, and Quin again made it up quite high, this time at least 2/3 of the way to the top. Below you will find the video of Jenny's reaction to our newly turned 4 year olds newly found obsession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe title="YouTube video player" class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/8c1lajS1uQc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Ethan&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ethan continues to stay busy. He continues to take piano lessons and has recently joined the school Swing Choir. While he hasn't had a concert yet, he has been learning the moves to the dances, which he occasionally comes home to show us. Of course, when he shows us his moves, Quin immediately wants to show us his own moves, which are actually very good - sometimes he even ends doing some sort of Little Richard drop to the floor...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cub Scouts has (finally) come to and end for Ethan and I when we celebrated his receiving of the Arrow of Light, Cub Scout's highest honor. He was very excited to be done with Cub Scouts, but also wants to move on to Boy Scouts and eventually earn his Eagle Scout. We'll see if he can stick to it, but right now that's the plan!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basketball is also (finally) over for the year. Ethan's team took first place in their league, and also won the St. Killian's of Hartford Tournament. In all he got 2 basketball trophies this year, the first for a second place finish in an earlier tournament. Ethan improved a lot this year, but still has a ways to go before he can compete with some of the other boys on the team. Most importantly, he learned a lot, and had fun doing it. I think he will probably try it again next year, and has actually been shooting around a lot since the season ended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a funny aside, the basketball tournament he had was in Hartford, about a 45 minute drive from our house. The way it worked, he played on consecutive Tuesdays, then played the championship game on a Saturday, so we were driving back and forth between Hartford and our house a few times during that tournament. The first game was what we thought was an 8:15 game, which turned out to be a miscommunication, so we got there late like almost the entire team did. That aside, they managed to win the game by 8:30, so Ethan and I were traveling back home through Hartford when we passed a sign that said "Free Scoop if your name is Ethan." I pulled over, parked the car, and Ethan ran into the ice cream shop that was boasting the sign. Being somewhat more cautious, I casually walked up to the shop and noticed that they were clearly cleaning up for closing. A quick glance at the placard out front indicated that they closed at 8:30, and my watch read 8:45. So I hung out outside and watched the scene transpire. Ethan walked confidently up to the counter, talked with a girl in uniform. She nodded, he pointed, she built him a cone, handed it to him, then said something. He shook his head, nodded, then walked out. I later found out what the conversation entailed. After boldly entering the "closed" shop, without missing a beat, he ordered a single scoop of Blue Moon. After the girl behind the counter handed him the cone, she said it would be $3.25. He said, "no it won't - my name's Ethan," and then walked out. I never did tell him that the shop was closed...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: none;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ewyAOWC566s/T0MBXtCsuyI/AAAAAAAABk8/jIAkgRDPnsU/Photo%252520Feb%25252014%25252C%2525202012%2525208%25253A42%252520PM.jpg" target="_blank" style=""&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ewyAOWC566s/T0MBXtCsuyI/AAAAAAAABk8/jIAkgRDPnsU/s500/Photo%252520Feb%25252014%25252C%2525202012%2525208%25253A42%252520PM.jpg" id="blogsy-1331524187856.7666" class="alignnone" alt="" width="383" height="512"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This basketball tournament was ripe with interesting conversation since we had 90 minutes to kill in the car each time we traveled up there. On one trip, I don't know how the conversation arrived on the topic, but we started talking about sex. I remembered that we had our talk about our bodies with the doctor when we were in fifth grade, so I figured he was going to be getting a lot of information some time in the near future, so I asked him, "so, you know that sex is how babies are made, right?" He answered, yes. I then asked him if he knew what it was. He said, "kind of. Isn't it that thing that people do with those weird balloons?" I didn't know how to react, so I stuck with the blunt approach. "You mean condoms? Where did you hear about those?" He told me that it was in the movie that he and I had watched, "The Naked Gun" with Leslie Nielson and Prescilla Preslie. There is a montage scene in there where the two of them fall in love, and being released in the 80s, safe sex was being preached, so the comical ending to the falling in love montage had them performing safe sex with each other in full body condoms... So I'm not sure how much he still understands, but hopefully he's not getting all of his information from the movies that I let him watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/1303245864482234892/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=1303245864482234892' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/1303245864482234892'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/1303245864482234892'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2012/03/potpourri.html' title='Potpourri'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/wyx6JDQCslE/default.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-4529924568114458161</id><published>2012-01-15T20:05:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2012-01-15T20:05:53.286-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Ethan'/><title type='text'>January update</title><content type='html'>&lt;p&gt;It's tough for me to write today because my favorite group of millionaires lost to somebody else's favorite group of millionaires in a game I was sure would go my millionaire's way. Oh well, we must persevere!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's been a typical busy couple of weeks. Today was one of Ethan's last functions as a Cub Scout, the Pinewood Derby. For most kids this is an exciting event, but for Ethan and I, we sort of dread it. Neither Ethan or I really understand what it takes to build a "good car." Our cars generally make it to the end of the track, but rarely very fast, and always much slower than most other cars. After the first year of innocence where we thought we could possibly achieve a place, we settled into the common goal of not finishing last. Last year we only achieved that goal by 1 or 2 places, and that was in the overall results, not just within our den! So it wasn't too shocking this year when Ethan told me that he didn't even want to make a car. Since I'm a den leader, though, I was bullied into pressuring him into making a car, so we did, but we did the barest minimum of work on it. No cuts, he wrapped it in a car wrapper purchased from the local hobby shop, we sanded and polished the axles and wheels like we've heard you should, and finally finished up the car on Saturday night. It wasn't much to look at, but it at least went straight!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today we held the derby at our church school. Ethan's car was doing OK. They run each car in 4 races, once in each lane. His car took 3rd of 4 in each race except for the last where he took 2nd, but his times were very competitive. When the math was done, we were shocked to see that he placed 3rd in the den, of 9 kids! It's his first trophy for any sort of individual (or team) event. I'm pretty sure I'm more excited about it...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can tell he wasn't all that excited because he had to leave early for his other weekend commitment, basketball. He and another boy from school are on a team with another local Catholic school who has a lot of really good players. Their team lays waste to most other teams they encounter, but not because of Ethan's play at all. Today, though, he actually got to shoot 5 times, and almost made several of them! When we were driving home from the game, he didn't say anything about the derby, only that he was sure he was going to sink at least one of those shots!!! He had a feeling he'd score points today!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quin's been his usual challenge, but is still full of surprising and funny comments. A few days ago, he, Ethan and I were sitting on the couch watching a movie. We all had our shoes off. I'm not sure how it happened, but at one point, Quin had put his foot on mine and Ethan had put his foot on Ethan's. Quin Looked at me and said, "Look Dad, we mad a sandwich!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few days later, Quin had gotten up earlier than everybody else in the house (again). He got tired of waiting for the rest of us to get ready, so he went upstairs to get himself ready. When he came down he had on a pair of orange pants and a shirt that was much too big for him. I told him that I liked his shirt, and he turned to me and said, "I know, I'm awesome!" Well, I suppose that self confidence is one of those nurture things...&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/4529924568114458161/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=4529924568114458161' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/4529924568114458161'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/4529924568114458161'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2012/01/january-update.html' title='January update'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-268808522114954315</id><published>2011-12-29T20:03:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2011-12-29T20:03:57.041-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><title type='text'>Catching up with Quinton</title><content type='html'>&lt;div&gt;It's been awhile, and in the spirit of New Year's resolutions, and in the spirit of the iPad keyboard I got from my parents for Christmas (thanks mom and dad), it's time I start blogging a bit more regularly. But to get regular, I first have to catch up with the past few weeks. Luckily, Quin is 3, and is constantly generating new blog material.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;You Like It?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;One of the things Quin is always asking is if you like something. Not only does he value your friendship, but he wants you to like the things that he likes. One of the phrases he uses when he particularly likes something is "let's buy it." It can apply to anything from a stick of gum to a store. Of late, he's been trying to impress us with toys or things that he's drawn, and then asking us - "you like it?" If we answer yes, he will immediately follow that up with, "you wanna buy it?"&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;You Better Not Shout, You Better Not Cry&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the nicest parts of having a three year old in capitalist America is the holiday season threat of no presents in exchange for good behavior. We are doubly lucky in our day and age in that we can text, e-mail, or call Santa on our cell phones, making the threat ever present. We used it like crazy! And for the most part it worked. After opening our presents in Christmas Eve (a Grady tradition), Quin woke up the next morning, said something naughty like "poopy" or something like that, then looked me in the eye and said, "Santa's not watching me any more..."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Damn you Steve Jobs!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'm an Apple fan boy - I like to believe that I'm more grounded than the real crazies, but I still spend way too much money on Apple gear. For example, I'm typing this on my iPad (my second), Quin is watching my iPhone 4, my computer is an iMac - you get the picture. Two summers ago when my cell phone contract was up, I upgraded to the iPhone 4 and gave Ethan my disabled iPhone 3g as a glorified iPod. This Christmas, taking after his dad, Ethan asked for the latest generation iPod so he could take video, something his 3g would not allow. So when Santa delivered on that request, Quin inherited Ethan's old 3g, and all the apps that Ethan had on there. We did a first volley of getting rid of all of the "inappropriate" apps (OK, we asked Ethan to do it, which may have been our big mistake) then gave it to Quin. He got rid of the gun apps and some others, but others he must have missed... As we were driving up to Neillsville on Christmas morning, we hear a fart sound coming from the back seat. We didn't think much of it, but it continued, and then Quin yelled to the car, "Mommy, stop farting!!!" Jenny looked back to find Quin pressing a button on some app that Ethan had "forgotten to delete" that made a pretty good fart sound.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's nice that Quin has his own iPhone now, but it hasn't stopped him from asking to use mine all the time. I suppose it's faster, has better games, etc. The other day, though, he came up to me like he will and asked, "Daddy, please I have your iPhone for Facebook?" Now I have no idea how he knows about Facebook or what he wanted to do about it. The only thing I can think of is that I constantly give Jenny crap about snagging my phone to catch up on my Facebook life. I suppose he does listen sometimes!&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skiing with Mr. Bill.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Last Friday was a day off of school and work for the family, so we traveled down to Alpine Valley ski resort (OK, it's a bump that they make snow on for skiing) for Ethan's ski club and Quin's first time skiing. I took him down the hill a couple of times, but apparently I must have shown my frustration and inability to handle this situation, because a clown skied up to us and offered to show Quin a couple of things. He took Quin up the magic carpet and had him down the hill in no time flat. Before I knew it, Quin was signed up for a private lesson with Mr. Bill the ski clown! I have to tell you, he did quite a job, though! By the end of the day, Mr. Bill had Quin on the chair lift on the big hill. By the time I got him, we went down the bunny hill two more times and all Quin wanted to do was go fast! He didn't even fall once while skiing down the hill.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: none;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-LReu3SCy7Sw/TvvU98RO3hI/AAAAAAAABjA/eNAAGgHbxYI/Photo%252520Dec%25252023%25252C%2525202011%25252011%25253A27%252520AM.jpg" target="_blank" style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-LReu3SCy7Sw/TvvU98RO3hI/AAAAAAAABjA/eNAAGgHbxYI/s349/Photo%252520Dec%25252023%25252C%2525202011%25252011%25253A27%252520AM.jpg" id="blogsy-1325209231797.0535" class="alignnone" width="349" height="261" alt=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="text-align: left;clear: both; "&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.292969); -webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(175, 192, 227, 0.230469); -webkit-composition-frame-color: rgba(77, 128, 180, 0.230469);"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="text-align: left;clear: both; "&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.292969); -webkit-composition-fill-color: rgba(175, 192, 227, 0.230469); -webkit-composition-frame-color: rgba(77, 128, 180, 0.230469);"&gt;Hopefully this is the first in a line of more regular updates.

We were lucky enough to be able to get some laundry done at mom and dad's before we left (OK, Jenny got it done), so we (Jenny) would not have to do it when we (Jenny) got home. But travel days are always a pain. Most of the morning was spent biding time until our flight. We departed pretty early for the airport - we had a 1:00 flight and arrived at the airport at 11:00, so we had plenty of time to get some pizza and wait at the gate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flight was uneventful. Quin slept for 3/4 of the flight. He woke up for about 20 minutes at one point, long enough to put a movie on, then fall asleep again. Ethan spent almost the entire flight doing homework, but he got it done! In the end, the only casualty was Ethan left his new cowboy hat on the plane. We have a lost and found ticket entered with the airline in hopes it might be returned, but we're not holding our breath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, this was definitely one of the best family vacations the four of us have taken together. That is in no small part due to the advancement in age of the boys. Ethan can be quite helpful when he wants, and is very curious about things, which makes it fun. Quin is full of energy, but you can just see him learning new things right before your eyes all the time - it's incredible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some miscellaneous observations that didn't make it into any of the 'blog entries but deserved a little space here in my "epilogue."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Californians are wearing pajama pants. Not sure what's up with that, but everywhere we went in the "hip and trendy" areas, people were walking around in pajama pants. Mark my words, in a couple of months to a year, it will be a craze around the country. Californians are weird...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Quin is starting the master the art of blaming his gas on other people. While riding in the car we heard a loud sound come from near my side of the car. Jenny and Ethan looked at me but I claimed innocence. Quin was smiling, but immediately said, "Mommy, you stink!!!" I guess that would be a &lt;i&gt;nurture&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;thing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Big thanks to Glen and Cheryl on this trip. Not only were they extraordinarily generous with their time and home while we were in Arizona, but they &lt;i&gt;gave us their car&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;for 4 days while they had only bicycles and their own 2 legs to get them around. I only hope I can return the favor to my ungrateful kids when they are vacationing 20 or 30 years from now. Thank you!!!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/5929114241761961978/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=5929114241761961978' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/5929114241761961978'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/5929114241761961978'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2011/11/great-west-adventure-day-9-travel-day.html' title='Great West Adventure - Day 9 - Travel day'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-8703592903793223169</id><published>2011-10-29T00:10:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2011-10-29T00:10:49.695-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Great West Adventure - Day 8 - Don't look down...</title><content type='html'>Day 8 was to be a relaxing day! In that right, it wasn't too bad. Mom and dad wanted to show off their new winter home state to us, though, so we headed out of town on Arizona 88 around 10:30 to catch up on some history and engineering marvels. Our first stop was Tortilla Flat, a (very) small stop on the way up to the Roosevelt Dam on the Salt River. What might be said about Tortilla Flat is that it is the last sane place to stop on Hwy 88 before you wish you had brought a dune buggy! After spending a short time in Tortilla Flat getting a beer and looking through some of the buildings, we headed out again on 88 with a destination of the Roosevelt Dam. 88, however, was the real attraction of today's trip. All along my dad was explaining to me how horrendous this road was, and let me drive to prove it to me. Of course I didn't really take this all that seriously - he's old, right!? Well, let me be the first to admit that this is far and away the nastiest drive I've taken in all my years. Not only is it a curvy, mountainous road with little or not shoulder or barrier between the road and the canyon floor many hundreds of feet down, but the road is unpaved and, seemingly, ribbed (for her pleasure). I'm not sure of the science behind dirt roads and why they get so bumpy, but this one seemed to have been made so on purpose, perhaps to keep people from going more than about 15 miles per hour. Anyway, our 28 mile trek from Tortilla Flat to Roosevelt Dam took well over an hour. We did stop for some lunch along the way at Apache Lake where Quin started out napping, and upon waking half way through the meal asked us "where is everybody?" Business was not bustling in Apache Lake today!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Roosevelt Dam was quite impressive itself. Not so much as the Hoover Dam that Jenny and I toured some years back, but still impressive any time you view an engineering feat like that. We quickly stopped at the Roosevelt Lake Visitor Center and promptly headed to the Tonto Monument, which was very, very cool. Remember when you were in grade school studying Native Americans and you got to the Pueblos built by those in the Southwest? These were those! Of course, these weren't &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;ones that you see in your textbook growing up as the Salado people were not quite the masons that those in more northern areas were, but it was really neat to see this piece of history that had only been known in books prior.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the drive back we took the "long route" through Globe on more traditional roads and highways. Now we are resting at mom and dad's place anticipating our return to reality tomorrow...</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/8703592903793223169/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=8703592903793223169' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/8703592903793223169'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/8703592903793223169'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2011/10/great-west-adventure-day-8-dont-look.html' title='Great West Adventure - Day 8 - Don&apos;t look down...'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-1586593772917337233</id><published>2011-10-28T23:49:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2011-10-28T23:50:06.490-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Disney Day 2</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_GlSVNK-LI/AAAAAAAAAD8/NIl78sAydNM/s1600-h/Disney-0.jpg"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_GgvFNK-KI/AAAAAAAAAD0/xZEFVpusu3g/s1600-h/Disney-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" border="0" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5184101376791869602" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_GgvFNK-KI/AAAAAAAAAD0/xZEFVpusu3g/s320/Disney-1.jpg" style="cursor: hand; cursor: pointer; float: right; margin: 0 0 10px 10px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;Found this in the archives and thought I would post it. It's pretty dated, but I'm sure it's got lots of good stuff in it!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;Good Night's Sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Our first night in the hotel was blissfully uneventful. &amp;nbsp;My biggest worry coming to this resort with an infant was that he would be up and&amp;nbsp;unconsolable&amp;nbsp;in the night and he would wake people up. &amp;nbsp;Turns out I had nothing to worry about all along. &amp;nbsp;In fact, I would say that Quin probably slept better at the hotel than he does at home. &amp;nbsp;That is most likely because we were so close by and it was easy to get up to tend to him. &amp;nbsp;Either way, it worked out well and I had nothing to complain about.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ethan slept in Grandpa and Grandma's room the first night, as we thought he might be kept awake by Quin more than by Grandma's snoring. &amp;nbsp;Nothing really stirred him, though, and he slept quite well through the night.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the morning, Jenny and I got up somewhat more rested than the day before. &amp;nbsp;We slept in until around 8:30 having only gotten up once each with Quin during the night, so we felt good enough to try out the 1.4 mile track that surrounds the lake in the middle of the grounds. &amp;nbsp;The Caribbean Beach Resort is a number of buildings organized into Islands. &amp;nbsp;Ours was Martinique. &amp;nbsp;Each of the islands surrounds a big lake in the middle with beaches surrounding it. &amp;nbsp;Each island also had its own pool, which we took advantage of several times. &amp;nbsp;Anyway, Jenny and I went for a small run then stopped by the central shop to get water for Quin's bottles and some snacks for breakfast. &amp;nbsp;After that, off to the parks!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;EPCOT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Our first stop for this day was EPCOT, which again stands for Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow. &amp;nbsp;We grabbed a quick snack for breakfast as we had reservations in EPCOT for a character lunch, then jumped on the bus to EPCOT.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Have I mentioned how big the Disney World Resort is? &amp;nbsp;Let me put it another way in case I haven't properly explained that yet. &amp;nbsp;From our hotel, we could see Spaceship Earth, the big ball in the center of EPCOT. &amp;nbsp;It seemed not at all far away. &amp;nbsp;However, after boarding the bus in the morning, it took us no less than 20 minutes to get to the park! &amp;nbsp;Now, after having consulted a map, I now know that it took a long time to get there because the park entrance was all the way around the park, forcing us to weave in and out of several highways to get there, but still, 20 minutes, and they are both on the same property!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;EPCOT, much like the Magic Kingdom before it, was BUSY! &amp;nbsp;There were people walking all over the place. &amp;nbsp;The weather was somewhat better than yesterday, but still not hot, which was OK since there were so many people around, hot weather would have made things uncomfortable.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The first look at EPCOT is no less amazing than that of the Magic Kingdom. &amp;nbsp;The huge Spaceship Earth structure dominating the sky right at the entrance, with the Beach Boys music playing (why the Beach Boys, I couldn't say), water fountains splashing about everywhere... &amp;nbsp;They definitely went the extra mile with this park to make it seem different.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;EPCOT is separated into two separate parts, Futureworld where there are a bunch of rides and attractions that deal with imagination, conservation, and life in the future, and the World Showcase, which has buildings and attractions attempting to capture the feel of different countries around the world. &amp;nbsp;Since it was quite busy, we decided to check out the newest attraction first, Soarin', which was located in "The Land," one of the buildings in Futureworld. &amp;nbsp;Well, that line was already around 2 hours long, so we did the next best thing, we caught a couple of shows.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The first show we saw was called "Live With the Land," which was narrated by Pumba, Timone, and Simba from the Lion King. &amp;nbsp;This, along with most attractions, seemed to have the actual actors doing the voice work for the video, which is impressive. &amp;nbsp;The show was pretty neat. &amp;nbsp;It was all about how we should conserve and live with the land instead of against it. &amp;nbsp;I found it somewhat ironic that Disney of all companies was preaching conservation when they pump millions of gallons of water through their fountains and use tons of plastic to deliver food to their hungry customers each day, but hey, the message is still important, and the show wasn't too bad.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The next attraction we took in was again in The Land. &amp;nbsp;This time we boarded a boat (a common theme in many Disney attractions) and toured through some labs that Disney had setup in an attempt to grow things in different ways. &amp;nbsp;This trip was pretty cool as it showed all kinds of different plants being grown in a huge greenhouse. &amp;nbsp;They also tried new ways of growing things, like suspending tomato plants in the air so that the air can get to the leaves properly, or growing tomatoes upside-down. &amp;nbsp;Fairly interesting stuff.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We had made reservations for a character lunch in The Land's table service restaurant for around 2:00, but after taking in our two shows we still had some time to burn, so we headed outside and went into a building titled "Imagineering." &amp;nbsp;This was basically a big hands-on playground of all sorts of technology that could change the future, stimulate the imagination, or educate in some other way. &amp;nbsp;They had stations setup with video games, fire&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Disney's Hollywood Studio&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Wore Out Part II&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/1586593772917337233/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link

type='html'>There was no plan in the works for today other than to drive back to Phoenix at some point. Small portion of the day, only 6.5 hours... Surprisingly, though, it seemed relaxed since we didn't have an itinerary. So we started out the day like we did any other day on vacation, we ate at a local breakfast establishment. This time we found a local favorite, Panera Bread. Excellent bagels and sandwiches - oh who am I kidding, we just wanted something fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The only thing we wanted to make sure we did on this day, other than drive back to Phoenix, was to go to and see Coronado Island. On the way, though, we found the Midway Museum, a decommissioned naval aircraft carrier. Wow, am I glad we stopped! It was fascinating! Of course, Quin was a little less than impressed, but I really liked it... Ethan was even able to earn his Junior Aviator wings by listening to the free audio tour and answering a page full of questions about the topics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several hours on the Midway, we found our way across the Coronado Bridge to Coronado Island where we parked on a local road, walked through the commerce district, and found Miguel's Cocina, which I found an interesting confluence of English and Spanish. Regardless, the food was quite good. Their special touch was given to the pre-meal chips and salsa where they provided an additional portion cup of cheese dip for your chips. Quin immediately commandeered the cheese dip until it was gone. He ran out half way through a chip and was quite disappointed to the point of crying and screaming until Jenny introduced him to the Salsa. That kid REALLY likes to dip things!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After lunch we found our way to the beach where we got our feet wet in what seemed like 55 degree water - seriously, it couldn't have been much warmer than that! The beach was gorgeous and large and the kids really enjoyed it. We only wish we would have had a couple of hours to spend there so the kids could play more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, we had to call it quits in California - I wanted to beat rush hour traffic out of town, and we didn't want to get back to Phoenix too late in the evening, so we packed up around 3:30 and took the arduous trip back to grandpa and grandma's house outside of Phoenix. We arrived around 10:00, not bad considering we stopped several times for bio breaks and food. Jenny quickly deposited a large load of clothes into the washing machine and we tried to wrestle the kids into bed so they wouldn't be too ornery the next day. Jenny and I followed quickly behind them - vacation is tiring!!!&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/6819574514782979722/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=6819574514782979722' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/6819574514782979722'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/6819574514782979722'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2011/10/great-west-adventure-day-7-permission.html' title='Great West Adventure - Day 7 - Permission to Board'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-6117679210800526610</id><published>2011-10-28T11:56:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2011-10-28T23:55:30.154-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Vacation'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Great West Adventure - Day 6 - It's a zoo out there</title><content type='html'>In case there was any question to the subtitle of yesterday's post, we were watching the weather where the cute weather lady exclaimed that the clouds were pretty moist and deep, and that she wouldn't be surprised to see them start to rain at any time. I found that amusing - I suppose I've never really progressed past the age of 12 as far as my maturity level goes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I again find myself 3 days tardy in posting this, so I think this will be pretty short. Today was about the zoo. The day started out a bit earlier than any of us would have liked. Around 6:25 AM, the hotel's fire alarm system started going crazy. We awoke in a daze, but figured out what was going on well enough to put some clothes on, grab our "necessities," (my wallet and keys to the car - oh, and the kids), and get outside. We weren't outside more than a couple of minutes before they gave us the all clear stating that it was a false alarm. No kidding... By this time, Quin was finally starting to wake up. As I was holding him in my arms, he took his head off my shoulder, looked up at me and said, "please I push the button?" Apparently to a kid of three, pushing the elevator button is pretty much the coolest thing you could ever hope to do. The entire week he would dash to the elevator anytime we hinted at going up or down in it. Ethan caught on, being the mean big brother, and taunted him at every turn, threatening to push the button instead of him, sometimes succeeding. Of course, being the opportunistic parents that we are, we used it as leverage to get Quin to do the things we wanted him to do. So, whenever we were heading to the elevator, he would ask us if he could be the one to push the button...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After our early start we needed to find a good place for breakfast. I turned to my mad internet skills and consulted "the Google" to find &lt;a href="http://www.oldtownhouserestaurant.com/"&gt;The Old Townhouse Restaurant&lt;/a&gt; at Ocean Beach. Now able to navigate the city proficiently, I got us there with minimal assistance from my navigator (Jenny) who manned the iPhone map application. The restaurant was on Newport Ave near the beach. We parked on the street right in front of a hostel, which I mistook as some sort of halfway house - I suppose I wasn't that far off... The restaurant didn't look like much on the outside, but the food and the service were fabulous!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The zoo is pretty much what you would expect from one of the most famous zoos in the world. Completely beautiful. Most of the time I didn't even know we were in a zoo. The animals just blended in with the surroundings. We did get lost from time to time before we finally figured out the lay of the land. Of course we were surrounded by some of the most exotic animals we've ever seen, but Quin was most impressed by the squirrel that passed in front of us. That's sort of his thing right now. Anytime he sees a squirrel, regardless of what he's doing, he will stop everything, point, and scream "squirrel!" Have you ever seen the Pixar movie Up! I believe it was Doug the dog. Anyway, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaAxzIFgNso"&gt;here's a link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We headed back to the hotel pretty early by our going standards, 4:00, where we finally got to enjoy the pool for a bit while Jenny and I enjoyed a beer on the patio. We finished the night at &lt;a href="http://www.oggis.com/"&gt;Oggi's Pizza and Brewing Company&lt;/a&gt; which was a short walk from our hotel room. The kids ate free, the beer was adequate, and the pizza above average.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After that, we were spent. Quin fell asleep by 7:30 again, the rest of us watched Gulliver's Travels on HBO (seemed like a short movie to me, though I may have napped through some of it).&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/6117679210800526610/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=6117679210800526610' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/6117679210800526610'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/6117679210800526610'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2011/10/great-west-adventure-day-6-its-zoo-out.html' title='Great West Adventure - Day 6 - It&apos;s a zoo out there'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-7598571721455642831</id><published>2011-10-25T23:36:00.003-05:00</published><updated>2011-10-25T23:57:14.958-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Vacation'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Great West Adventure - Day 5 - Moist and Deep</title><content type='html'>Man, I have to start doing these as they happen. This is my third log today!!! To get me through it, I've gone to the fridge to finish off my San Diego brew sampler with a Karl Strauss Brewing Company Boardwalk Black Rye. Tasty!!!&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Today's plan was to go to Seaworld. We figured we would do things a little differently today since we completely missed supper yesterday, so we opted for a smaller breakfast of Subway sandwiches and Starbucks. After breakfast we headed north to Seaworld, San Diego.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Much like yesterday, Seaworld seemed pretty dead. To start the day we were walking right up to anything we wanted to do! Later in the day the park filled up a bit more, but it is definitely nice to be here "off season."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We started out in the penguin habitat where we got to see a trainer feeding some of the penguins out front. Interesting things we learned about penguins included the fact that Seaworld is the only place in the Western Hemisphere where you can see Empire Penguins, and that some birds can dive up to 1700 feet, almost twice as much as a killer whale!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We then went to see an educational program on Shamu - it turns out Shamu is more of a code name for the killer whales than the name of an actual whale. There was once a whale called Shamu, she was Namu's partner in the Pacific Northwest, the first two killer whales purposefully captured and kept in captivity. They gave us a little bit of a peek into some of the training methods they use with the whales - quite impressive.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Most of the day was spent attending shoes, from the sea lions and sea otter show, to the dolphin show, to the Pets Rule show, then back to the Shamu show. The dolphin show was particularly good, and the sea lion show was a family favorite. The kids had their ebbs and flows throughout the day - we did get a quick lunch, but the kids waned in the early afternoon hours while we hit show after show. Later in the afternoon they rallied as we started doing rides instead of shows. Ethan, Quin, and I went on Journey to Atlantis, a combination flume ride and roller coaster. Quin &lt;i&gt;just&lt;/i&gt; qualified to go on the ride, so he was pretty excited. Jenny didn't want to go on it, however, since we stood a good chance of getting wet. When it was our turn to board the boats, Quin advanced towards it and tripped, hitting his face on the side of the boat. Looked like it hurt, and the waterworks came on. The people manning the ride were a bit concerned, thinking he was afraid of the ride. I checked to see that he wasn't bleeding, then convinced him that he wasn't hurt, and he came through to smile before they would let the boat go off. It was quite a ride, quick drops, splashes, dark caves, then it went out of water to a roller coaster area. Lots of fun. Quin was &lt;i&gt;all smiles&lt;/i&gt;. At one point he looked at me and said, "that was awesome!"&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We again spent the entire day in the water park. When we got out of the park we drove downtown for our first glimpse of San Diego proper and got a quick dinner at the Edgewater Cafe. The kids were most likely overtired, and that translated into them being very loud and acting like robots for quite a long time. When we got back to the room at 7:30, we put Quin in his pajamas, brushed his teeth, then kept him still for about 30 seconds before he crashed, which brings us to now. Ethan is complaining that we aren't letting him go to bed, so Jenny and I are heading into the other room to entertain ourselves while he goes to bed on the couch - that's right, Jenny, Quin, and I are sleeping together on the king bed in the bedroom while Ethan occupies the couch by himself. I suppose that's why they call it a trip instead of a vacation when you travel with your kids...&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/7598571721455642831/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=7598571721455642831' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/7598571721455642831'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/7598571721455642831'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2011/10/great-west-adventure-day-5-moist-and.html' title='Great West Adventure - Day 5 - Moist and Deep'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-3126845226117766125</id><published>2011-10-25T23:16:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2011-10-25T23:36:02.810-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Vacation'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Great West Adventure - Day 4 - A Ton of Bricks</title><content type='html'>Day 4 - San Diego. Today started out early with Quin waking around 6:00 - he's getting better. He and I passed time playing iOS games on the iPhone and iPad in the second room of our suite while Jenny and Ethan grabbed 90 more minutes of sleep. By 7:30, Jenny got up and I hit the road for a quick run along the water.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;By 9:00 we were off for a full day of vacationing. We decided to load up on breakfast since our plans for the day included Legoland, and our guess was that food would be somewhat expensive there. So I mapped out Perry's Cafe near the freeway where we all ate enough to skip the next several meals - well, I did anyway! Delicious!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We then headed north to Carlsbad, the home of Legoland California. Our day there started by 10:30 and the park was next to deserted! Apparently Mondays in October aren't a high traffic time for amusement parks in Carlsbad. No worries. We took in a couple of immediate rides and weren't so impressed. Hopefully this wasn't going to be a stinker! By noon we still hadn't really done much that was too exciting - in fact we waited for about 30 minutes in line for this bicycle ride that was really pretty lame.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Things started to pick up a bit when Jenny and Quinton found full sized, human powered Lego firetrucks lined up for a fireman competition. Our family took on 4 others in moving the firetruck about 50 feet by pumping it like a manual rail car (like in O! Brother Where Art Though), then getting off and putting out a fire using 2 squirt guns, then powering the vehicle back 50 feet. We came in a close second - I blame Jenny as she was manning the device that determined the direction of the vehicle. About 10 feet into our initial surge, she decided to throw it in reverse to test how it worked. I'm pretty sure that cost us precious feet that ultimately would have left us the champs! Oh well.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The day REALLY picked up when we found our way to Miniland, which is an area with Lego models of the United States and several scenes from Star Wars. The Star Wars area was very cool - the designers capturing some of the pivotal moments of all 6 movies and one of the cartoon movies. We spent quite some time there. Then we discovered the USA where they had modeled large sections of San Francisco, Las Angeles, Las Vegas, Washington DC, and New York all in bricks. They even had a small patch that was apparently "The Midwest." I have to say I was a little insulted. The seemed to put thousands of hours of thought and workmanship into painstakingly replicating every last detail of Las Vegas, then the midwest had a couple of tractors, a church, and a rodeo... We had a hard time getting Quin out of this area - he was completely transfixed by these Lego cars that were automated. He stood and watched this piano truck in San Francisco for no less than 5 minutes. We had to tell him about all the other cool moving cars in the other areas. In all I would estimate we spent at least an hour in Miniland.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After a quick lunch (Jenny didn't eat enough for breakfast) we ended up with some really fun rides in Adventureland, Pharoh's Curse (or something), and Castleland. Ethan and I got onto a decent roller coaster, but they wouldn't let Quin on. Even though he qualified for the minimum height of 42", Jenny mistakingly admitted his real age of 3 and a half, when they had a strict minimum of 4. The most fun ride of the day turned out to be in Castleland, the Knight's Quest. It was a strange confluence of new and old with chairs nestled atop these huge robotic arms. Two people would sit in the chairs and select one of 5 different programs, each program getting progressively more aggressive. Jenny and Quin were unable to do any program by 1, the only one allowed for folks under 48". Ethan and I had no restrictions, however, so we went for a 4. I'm pretty sure we could have gone for a 5. Our last ride of the day was the Dragoncoaster, Quinton's first roller coaster. As we expected, he &lt;i&gt;loved it&lt;/i&gt;. It's sometimes easy to forget how easy going and adventurous Quin is. I remember taking Ethan to an amusement park in the past, he was 4 or 5, and he was petrified of many rides. We also saw lots of kids at Legoland, kids Ethan's age and older that were crying uncontrollably at the thought of doing a "scary ride." Not Quin, he wanted to ride everything. After the ride he loudly exclaimed, "That was awesome!"&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After a long day, we headed back south toward our hotel. Carlsbad is about 30 miles north of San Diego, and since it was rush hour we decided to take the scenic route back, so we got onto Hwy 101 and headed south. Quin fell asleep before we got out of the Legoland parking lot, but the rest of us enjoyed a beautiful drive along the coast. At one point we spotted a large group of dolphins feeding or something, so we pulled off the road and watched them for awhile. It was the first time Ethan saw dolphins outside of captivity.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The day ended much like the previous. Quin finally woke up around 6:30, so we had a hard time getting him to bed before 9:30, but once he went down, the rest of us followed in order and quickly. Vacation kicking our butt once again!&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/3126845226117766125/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=3126845226117766125' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/3126845226117766125'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/3126845226117766125'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2011/10/great-west-adventure-day-4-ton-of.html' title='Great West Adventure - Day 4 - A Ton of Bricks'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-1424977857248544867</id><published>2011-10-25T22:57:00.003-05:00</published><updated>2011-10-25T23:16:13.062-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Vacation'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Great West Adventure - Day 3</title><content type='html'>Since we were up by 6:00 anyway, we decided to try to get an early start at things, so we got ready and left by 8:00. My parents graciously lent us their vehicle - they are currently going without any sort of motorized vehicle of their own, relying instead on pedal power and favors from friends - so we loaded it up and took off on our 6 and 1/2 hour drive to San Diego. Before we left town we had to make a quick stop at Starbucks to get Jenny her vacation nectar, Tall non-fat Chai Tea Latte, and at the gas station for a Pepsi Max for me - it's not a diet soda, it's a zero calorie soda for &lt;i&gt;men&lt;/i&gt;! At one point, Quinton asked "where are we going?" I explained we were going to Starbucks to get mommy a coffee - he responded, "oh darn it, I wanted to go to California." I need to take this opportunity to say that the gas station/car wash/oil change establishment at the intersection of Highway 60 and Signal Butte Drive in Apache Junction is perhaps the most beautiful gas station I've ever encountered. From the clean, modern, southwest exterior, to the wide aisles, copious beverage choice, leather chairs, high definition televisions while you wait... It was spectacular!&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The drive took us south almost immediately. After about 2 hours we were ready for a quick stop just as we were about to get onto Interstate 8 headed for California where we picked up some Mike and Ikes for Ethan and quickly used the bathroom. As we got onto I8, we had the option to go West to San Diego, or South to Mexico. So I gave the family the option, Mexico or San Diego. Ethan and Quinton both shouted simultaneously "San Diego," so I guess we were committed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The drive was mostly uneventful to Yuma where we used the iPhone to locate a park, Kennedy Park off of Exit 2, then navigated to it for a quick picnic lunch compliments Grandma Cheryl, meat and cheese sandwiches, Fritoes, bananas and apples. It was nice to stop and stretch our legs and let the kids play on the toys in the park. It was a beautiful day - 95 degrees, not humid, not a cloud in the sky. In fact, Jenny and I were amazed that there was almost nobody out to enjoy the beautiful day. As far as we could tell, people were either sleeping in (until noon), going to church, or it was just not such an oddity for them to have such a beautiful day on their hands so nobody was out taking advantage of it. A day like this in Wisconsin in October would be a recipe for some of the poorest daytime television ratings days of all time!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;On our way out of town we had our first vehicle mishap. While putting Quin back in the car and trying to close the automatic sliding door, the door started to "misbehave." We have a similar car at home, and if something gets in the way of the door closing, it reopens then starts beeping crazily. If you try to drive with the door open, it does the same thing. Well, that started happening. The door opened and would not close. When we were able to get the door to close by quickly locking it before it re-opened, it would beep uncontrollably. We drove for about a mile with it in that state until we got to a gas station where we filled up with gas and continued to debug the door. After about 30 minutes, I finally found a combination that left the door closed without any beeping of any sort. Since then, we have not touched it - Quin has been getting out on Ethan's side!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We finally entered California for the last part of our drive. We were mildly nervous that we would get searched at one of three border patrol stops along the way and that they would make us open Quin's door, but our fears were not realized and we cruised right through to San Diego, where the weather finally turned cooler. In fact, we stopped at a gas station for some Slurpees about 20 miles East of San Diego and the thermometer read 87 degrees. Not more than 5 miles down the road, the thermometer read 67!!!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We eased off the interstate on Rosencrans Road and were greeted by a big sign, "Live Nude Girls." Jenny and I looked at each other and wondered without saying anything if our recent hotel luck was going to continue. The last two times we've gotten hotel rooms we've had less than pleasing experiences. Were we staying in the red light district? Well, again our fears were not realized as within a few blocks we started seeing signs for Trader Joes and seeing nice cars parked on the side of the road.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Our hotel, the Courtyard in Libertyville, is nice enough - clean, dry, and in a nice area. We took some time to walk around the area before we ventured out for some supper in the Ocean Beach area, only 4 miles from the hotel. We ate supper at a Mexican restaurant near the ocean while we watched Sunday night football. We then headed down to the beach to let the kids get their feet wet - Quin scared the heck out of me when he started to chase the tide out to the ocean. I had glimpses of the tide taking him out to sea and me having to frantically try to find him in the dark waters, but he must have seen the fear in my face and quickly came back up the beach towards me.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When we got back to the room it was about 8:00 - we got Quin ready for bed and he fell asleep within perhaps 2 minutes - the rest of us didn't last much longer...&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/1424977857248544867/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=1424977857248544867' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/1424977857248544867'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/1424977857248544867'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2011/10/great-west-adventure-day-3.html' title='Great West Adventure - Day 3'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-1591710849896367626</id><published>2011-10-23T22:56:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2011-10-23T23:03:26.967-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Vacation'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Great West Adventure - Day 2</title><content type='html'>As should probably be expected, since Quin went to bed at around 6:00 local time, he woke up around 4:30 local. I suppose the day was going to start early! We aimed to do quite a bit during this day, but ultimately decided to back it off a bit seeing as how we were still a bit groggy from the previous day's travels. We did manage to get to the &lt;a href="http://www.superstitionmountainmuseum.org/"&gt;Superstition Mountain Museum&lt;/a&gt; which is the site of an old Hollywood set for westerns which only recently burned to the ground. We also spent some time at &lt;a href="http://www.superstitionmountainmuseum.org/"&gt;Goldfield Ghost town&lt;/a&gt; where we got to see a gunfight, Ethan bought a cowboy hat, and we ended up taking in some old west entertainment at the Saloon.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The day was not without excitement, however. In the morning, Jenny and I went to get some Starbucks and to get some things from WalMart, something we have to do each day during vacation. When I went to get my credit card from my wallet, I was shocked to find it missing! Luckily I remembered using it at a different WalMart the day before, and a quick call to them proved that I had indeed left it there. Something about vacations makes me sloppy with my wallet!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;At the end of the day, while my dad cooked chicken for supper and Jenny and mom went to Kohls to look for sweet deals, the boys and I were watching the Superstition Mountains turn different colors in the sunset. Ethan and I got onto the topic of Spanish, saying different phrases in Spanish to each other. At one point, Ethan said to me, "Say shut-up in Spanish." Quinton, without missing a beat, said "Shut-up in Spanish." Not a single hint of irony in his voice... He's got great timing, I'll give him that.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/1591710849896367626/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=1591710849896367626' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/1591710849896367626'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/1591710849896367626'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2011/10/great-west-adventure-day-2.html' title='Great West Adventure - Day 2'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-6822225277209942776</id><published>2011-10-21T22:40:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2011-10-23T22:56:15.685-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Vacation'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Great West Adventure - Day 1</title><content type='html'>3:45 AM - the alarm called out the start of our Great West Adventure. We were ticketed for a 7:00 departure from Milwaukee's General Mitchell Airport. With 3 and 10 year old in tow, we didn't want to leave anything to risk. So we all showered the night before, set the alarm for 3:45, and aimed to leave by 4:15.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The plan went off without a hitch - the crew was excited for the trip. We pulled into our offsite parking lot at 5:10, plenty of time to spare. I suppose we could have probably slept a little longer, but who knows on a work day how bad traffic will get. After a quick shuttle ride we were at the ticketing counter, then off to the gate to meet up with our first trip on Southwest Airlines.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'm not sure if you've flown Southwest before, but here's how it works. Basically it's like a bus - you get on the plane, pick a seat, and sit there. Their fares are pretty low and they don't charge for luggage, so we decided to risk it. In actuality they do give you a number to board, so we would have been the 90th people to board the aircraft, if we hadn't "won the lottery" by traveling with Quin. After the preferred ticket holders, group A, Soutwest lets families with children under 5 board so they can hope to sit together. Us and another family took advantage of this rule and boarded the plane. Quin and I sat together in one row with Jenny and Ethan sitting behind us. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The flight was pretty uneventful. Quin couldn't wait to "blast off". As we taxied down the runway to do so, however, he promptly fell asleep for about 30 minutes, some of the most peaceful on the flight for me!! Actually he was a good flyer. Surprisingly, another set of good flyers were the set of 2 dachshunds flying in this woman's carryon a couple rows ahead of us. I couldn't believe that they would sit still and quiet for a 4 hour flight in that little bag!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When we got to Arizona, Mom and Dad Grady picked us up at Sky Harbor Airport, still the best name for an airport as far as I can determine. Though we arrived fairly early in the day - we got to mom and dad's southern home by 11 AM local time, we were pretty well spent. We took the rest of the day fairly easy by picking up some odds and ends that we weren't able to pack and swimming in the old folk's pool at the community. One smallish faux pax on my part was that I bought the wrong pull-ups for Quinny. He still sleeps in night-time pull-ups. I was assigned to go to WalMart and pick up some various things that we couldn't get, one of which were pull-ups. Jenny and Ethan were shocked to find that I had actually purchased princess pull-ups rather than the normal Cars 2 pull-ups. Luckily Quinny was OK with it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We dined out at &lt;a href="http://www.organstoppizza.com/"&gt;Organ Stop Pizza&lt;/a&gt; in Mesa for dinner, truly an amazing sight! This largish restaurant is completely filled with glockenspiels, pipes, drums, dancing cats, and gobs of other things, all hooked into the central organ where the organist controls it all. We got to take in a 45 minute show while we polished off a pitcher of beer and 2 pizzas.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Back to the folk's pad, we finished up the evening fairly early. I'm pretty sure we were all sleeping by 8:00 local time. Mom and dad were surprised until they realized that we had been up since 2:00 AM local time... All in all it was a decent travel day.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/6822225277209942776/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=6822225277209942776' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/6822225277209942776'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/6822225277209942776'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2011/10/great-west-adventure-day-1.html' title='Great West Adventure - Day 1'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-2983627166964468121</id><published>2011-09-18T19:57:00.003-05:00</published><updated>2011-09-18T20:14:57.951-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Ethan'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Jenny'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Fitness'/><title type='text'>Staying in Shape</title><content type='html'>Four years ago I ran in my first organized race since I graduated from high school when I participated in a sprint level triathlon. Since then I got in shape, got out of shape, lost 30 pounds, and have been in pretty decent shape since then. I've also managed to run in a half marathon, 2-200 mile relays, a number of 5Ks, 10Ks, a 20K, trail runs, road runs, you name it. After all of these races, my last two have been the most enjoyable for me.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My first half marathon was a year ago at the Lake Country Half Marathon in Oconomowoc. This year, a friend of mine told me that his son of 11 was going to run the 5K version of that same event and he was going to run it with him. I thought this was a great idea and immediately convinced Ethan it to do it with me. Throughout the summer he "trained" off and on, but never wavered from the course, he was going to run the race with me. Well, my buddy's son ended up not running the race, but Ethan and I ran it. He didn't train a whole lot, and when he did, he ran SLOW, so I figured we would finish the race in around 40 minutes. When we finally got to the race, though, he ran the whole thing and completed it in just over 30 minutes, that's about a 9:40/mile pace. It was very gratifying to run a race with Ethan. It took me 34 years to discover the joys of staying in shape - I only hope that I can instill it in him early so he doesn't have to go through that painful period of getting in shape once he's well beyond it!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My most recent race was today when Jenny, Tim Z, Steve K, and I participated in the Warrior Dash. This race is one in a series of many "mud runs" that have been popping up over the last couple of years. It's a 5K run in a farm field with a bunch of obstacles thrown in. Jenny and I ran it together and had a great time! A sign reading "Danger, Obstacle Ahead" would warn us of each impending contraption to slow our pace. Obstacles included climbing walls, cargo nets, barbed wire crawls, fires we had to jump over, and finally a 50 foot long mud pit that you had to swim through to evade the barbed wire hung over it. It was a very fun event, very well run, but what made it most fun was doing it with Jenny.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'm pretty lucky to be able to enjoy this pastime with my family. I'm really looking forward to the day when we can corrupt Quinny into doing these crazy things. Maybe one day I can cross a finish line with my whole family beside me - that would be fun.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/2983627166964468121/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=2983627166964468121' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/2983627166964468121'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/2983627166964468121'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2011/09/staying-in-shape.html' title='Staying in Shape'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-759079045279857339</id><published>2011-08-22T07:19:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2011-08-22T07:28:14.374-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Heinz'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Welcome our new Family Member</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_7qjXOD1JAw/TlJJqKPXS1I/AAAAAAAABeU/2mNCzVDcaIE/s1600/IMG_1172.jpg" onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 239px; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_7qjXOD1JAw/TlJJqKPXS1I/AAAAAAAABeU/2mNCzVDcaIE/s320/IMG_1172.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5643654271700781906" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;A big welcome to Heinz Doofenshmirtz Grady, our new puppy! Heinz comes to us from Little Buddies Rescue where he was dropped off from a puppy mill. We originally went there intending to adopt his sister, but she had already been spoken for by the time we got there. No worries! Heinz immediately endeared himself to us by fetching a toy for Ethan - a sure way to his heart! He had to stay at the rescue for a few more days so he could be neutered and have his initial vaccinations, so we went and picked him up yesterday. Unfortunately Ethan is up north spending some time with his grandparents, so he was not here to help us bring Heinz home. Quinton has been a lot of help, though! He was so impressed yesterday by the decrease in attention that he pooped his pants!&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Heinz is about 11 weeks old. I had forgotten what a pain in the butt new puppies can be! He's pretty well behaved so far, but I fear he's still being shy and will quickly show his naughtiness. He did not come crate trained, but took to it with little complaint last night. He even lasted through the night (7 hours) without having to go to the bathroom.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We look forward to many years with Heinz Doofenshmirtz as our new family member!&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/759079045279857339/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=759079045279857339' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/759079045279857339'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/759079045279857339'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2011/08/welcome-our-new-family-member.html' title='Welcome our new Family Member'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_7qjXOD1JAw/TlJJqKPXS1I/AAAAAAAABeU/2mNCzVDcaIE/s72-c/IMG_1172.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-6562981886939255302</id><published>2011-07-24T20:49:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2011-07-24T21:04:54.007-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><title type='text'>Catching up with Quinton</title><content type='html'>Neither Jenny nor I are very good about creating content for a baby book. In fact, I know I could not tell you where either of my children's baby books are - perhaps in the top of our closet collecting dust. To capture memories, though, I've turned to this 'blog. It worked out pretty well with Ethan so far, and Quinton has been no different. This post, then, is going to be some quick hitters to get into Quinton's virtual baby book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy age three for some reasons, and really detest it for others. Most of the 3 year olds I know are some of the funniest people you could ever hold a conversation with. Quin is no exception. The other day Jenny bought a new swimming suit as she's prone to do from time to time. She brought it home and tried it on. While looking herself over in the mirror, Quin came into the room, looked at her, and said to her, "Mommy, you look fancy."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quin is quite a lady's man, from many perspectives. For one, he's never shy about telling us about the girls he likes. He'll see what I would consider an attractive young lady walking past and loudly say, "Hi!!" to her until she responded. If he gets a little extra attention from her, he'll put his hands on either side of my face (so I can hear him better) and tell me, "I like that girl!" He'll do the same thing with women on television. Another example is at Ethan's baseball games. A couple of weeks ago, one of Ethan's teammate's sisters decided she was going to play soccer with Quin for like an hour (God bless her!). She's about 12 years old, and Quin had a blast with her. Last Thursday, then, we were at another park playing on the playground equipment while Jenny watched the game (we have to take turns). I had convinced Quin that we should go sit by mommy for awhile so I could take in some of the game. He agreed in principal and started to follow me when he spotted his playmate from the previous week. He stopped short, got my attention and said, "daddy, wait here, I have to say hi to that girl," after which he immediately walked over to her, said hi, and started playing with her again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't end there, however. Quin is quite smitten with pink. He also likes to dress in Jenny's high heels and sunglasses while carrying around one of her pretty purses. He gets mad at her if she takes the purse away, complaining that "I had it first!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the last two days he's been particularly enamored with pink and princesses, though I suspect the sudden surge in interest has more to do with what he did yesterday than some new trend. Yesterday morning we were up north for our 20th class reunion. We went out to Jenny's folk's house to drop off some cargo and Jenny's sister and her two boys were there. Emmet is 4 and learned to ride a 2 wheel bike this year. Grandpa had found one of the older grandkid's bikes, and pink princess bike, and lowered the seat so he could ride it. Emmet was so excited that he had to show Quin right away. I was inside, glancing out once in awhile, and I noticed that Quin was striding the bicycle and trying to push himself off. Not wanting to miss the opportunity, I rushed outside, held the bike for him, pushed him off, and away he went! Unbelievably he was able to ride for quite awhile before crashing into the grass. Each time he would fall down he would want to get up and try it again! Emmet got a little upset, so we had to take turns, but Quin insisted on taking his turn. I took this video as proof - I'm not sure I still believe it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/IOXRbms_7pI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/6562981886939255302/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=6562981886939255302' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/6562981886939255302'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/6562981886939255302'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2011/07/catching-up-with-quinton.html' title='Catching up with Quinton'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/IOXRbms_7pI/default.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-4301135038576102</id><published>2011-07-10T21:56:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2011-07-10T22:04:30.200-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Ethan'/><title type='text'>Buyer Beware</title><content type='html'>A couple of weeks ago I ran a Webelos Scout Camp for Ethan and his Cub Scout cohorts (I know, the scouts are an intolerant bunch, but that doesn't have to affect Ethan's learning - let's keep this among adults, shall we). The camp was pretty enjoyable - the boys were tasked with setting up the tents and camp themselves, had to take part in meal prep and cleanup, etc. Part of each camp is doing some kind of craft. After observing how crazy the kids went for this Indian neck thing they made at the winter camp, I thought it would be fun to do some kind of craft where the kids could make something and take it home with them - something they could wear. I came across "Paracord Survival Bracelets" through my searching, which turned out to be right up their alley. A week or so before the camp, I practiced by making one for myself, then I showed Ethan how to do it. After about 5 minutes he had picked it up, and about 10 - 15 bracelets later, he had decided that he was going into business!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So - if you find yourself heading down here for the party this coming weekend, please don't be surprised if Ethan attempts to peddle his wares on you. His business is making survival bracelets, obviously. For $5 you can get up to a 9 inch premade bracelet. For an extra dollar, he'll make it custom for you on the spot, specially fit for your wrist! I am interested to see if he actually follows through with it, because he's been talking about it for weeks now. His goal is to earn enough money to buy a laptop, his latest obsession. When I asked him what his company would be called, without missing a beat he proclaimed "E-biz." He then went out to explain what that meant to me, which was pretty funny...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, we hope to see you at this very special occasion this coming weekend. And we apologize up front if our first born tries to weasel you out of some of your money. Laptops aren't cheap, you know!!!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/4301135038576102/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=4301135038576102' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/4301135038576102'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/4301135038576102'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2011/07/buyer-beware.html' title='Buyer Beware'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-2387342037429783433</id><published>2011-06-27T10:38:00.003-05:00</published><updated>2011-06-27T10:41:01.573-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Firsts'/><title type='text'>Quin's First Movie</title><content type='html'>Cars 2 is out!

I'm happy to report that there was nothing out of the ordinary that happened... Yeah, boring blog post, but I'll take it. I'd say he was as good as, if not a little better than Ethan when we took him to his first movie (I don't recall which movie that was right now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One nice side bar of the first movie story was that I got to enjoy a rare treat this morning. Since the movie started at 6:45, Quin didn't get to sleep until about 9:30 last night, so I had the vary rare pleasure of waking him up this morning! Ah, payback. I can't wait until he's a teenager - I plan to wake him up every weekend for at least 3 years!!!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/2387342037429783433/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=2387342037429783433' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/2387342037429783433'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/2387342037429783433'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2011/06/quins-first-movie.html' title='Quin&apos;s First Movie'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-5530357261608592329</id><published>2011-06-12T21:24:00.003-05:00</published><updated>2011-06-12T21:31:10.186-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><title type='text'>My Mac is actually a Slot Machine!!!</title><content type='html'>The other day, Jenny wanted me to burn a DVD for her to give to a person at church. I told her no problem, grabbed a blank DVD which I promptly attempted to insert into my Mac superdrive. I was somewhat surprised to find that I could not put the DVD into the drive, however. The cmoputer did not say there was anything in the drive... Quite strange, I thought. I suppose that there could be a disc in there that the OS didn't know about somehow, a computer glitch. So I went to "the Google" and researched how to force the Mac DVD drive to eject. Having found my solution, I executed it according to instructions. The drive whined and made that mechanical eject noise, but no DVD appeared.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I did what anybody would have done, I grabbed a letter opener and jammed it into my Mac's drive. OK, maybe a dumb idea, particularly with the power still on, but I'm not always the brightest. I was surprised that at one end of the drive my letter opener met resistance, and that resistance moved when I prodded it. So I unplugged the computer (finally coming to my senses) and continued my surgery. My efforts were quickly rewarded when a nickel and 2 pennies dropped from the drive! I wonder who could have put those in there? I suppose it's possible that the computer is actually now making money...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the story didn't entirely end there. I was now able to put a disc into the drive, but it would not read. By now I suspected there was probably more in the drive, so I unplugged again and this time tipped the machine on its side when another penny and a quarter dropped out!!! In short, my computer somehow generated 33 cents for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the old days, I would have quipped that this was a result of one of my sons wanting to play a video game on the computer - but in today's terms, putting any sort of coin into anything is quaint - so I really have no idea what would have led Quinton (yeah, I'm pretty sure it was him) to try to put money in this location...</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/5530357261608592329/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=5530357261608592329' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/5530357261608592329'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/5530357261608592329'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2011/06/my-mac-is-actually-slot-machine.html' title='My Mac is actually a Slot Machine!!!'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-8723636759970350362</id><published>2011-05-22T21:19:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2011-05-22T21:21:35.282-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='TMI'/><title type='text'>Quinnie Quickie - TMI</title><content type='html'>File this one under TMI (that's "too much information" for those not in the know).

It's tough really to get my head around that fact. I can only imagine what it is like for my parents to think about each year one of their aging children reaches another annual milestone.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;9 was a pretty good year. Ethan's shown a lot of improvement in school, thanks to his mother's constant prodding and encouragement, he's begun to really shine at the piano, and is starting to show real promise at soccer. I'm not saying that he's looking like he may be Pele one day, but considering our dismay at his total lack of competitiveness or energy in previous years, this year has been one of wonder! It's hard not to have high, unreasonable expectations of your kids. Lord knows how badly we've screwed him up already. Well, I suppose we get pretty good contact with him for the next 8 years or so (man, is it that few?!?!!), hopefully we don't mess it up even worse than we have...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So this year we decided to allow Ethan to have a friend party with all the boys from school. Since Ethan's class is pretty small, it is easy, or rather required to invite all of the boys in his class. Luckily, all 6 (including Ethan himself) were able to attend! I picked the boys up at school at 3:30 and traveled with them into Waukesha for a couple of hours of lasertag. I'm not sure when the last time any of you has spent a considerable amount of time with a carload of 10 year olds, but it really opens your eyes about all the stuff they already know. Their conversations ranged from cars to jokes ("that's what she said" - they are getting better with that one - probably 70% of the references would work) to music (ACDC is the best, Mr. Grady) to movies. It ranged quite a lot. Even though the topic was anything but constant, one thing that did not stop was the chatter! They can talk A LOT! It was kind of nice to see that they are still, for good or for bad, very much influenced by their families. All of them liked the same cars their dad's liked, the same music their mom's liked, and had the same opinions about the world as their parents. I'm guessing that's going to change sometime soon, but for now, it seems we still have influence...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Lasertag was pretty enjoyable. Jenny and Quin met us there for the first game. Jenny quickly purchased $40 in game tokens for the arcade games which the boys burned through in about 15 minutes. Luckily they were completely loaded down in prize tickets which they each exchanged for handfuls of candy and some alien in a test-tube toy. Candy... Good idea!!! After the second game of lasertag was done and they had burned through all of my cash for game tokens, I tried to buy them all a slushie at the snack counter. Unfortunately the slushie machines were on the fritz, so I said, "just get a soda". What do you suppose they all ordered? "Mountain dew", "Code Red", one of them actual asked me if they could get a Monster Energy Drink... I was quickly losing control!!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After the last game of lasertag I loaded the gang up into the van to leave. That's when one of the boys flipped off a passerby... Oh boy, now I'm going to get beat up! The kids explained to me that this group of 11 year olds was really giving them trouble in the arena and demanding their respect, so they really had no choice but to flip them off!!!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The ride to our house was somewhat quiet. Most of the boys settled in to watch Ironman 2 which I had playing on the van DVD player. When we got to our house, the kids ran in and bee lined up to Ethan's room, right past a smiling and anxious Quin. By the time I got into the house, Quin was in tears! He had been patiently waiting for the boys to come home and play with him, but none of them even said hi!!! Luckily after a couple of minutes they came back down and started interacting with Quin as well. He couldn't have been happier! He came up to me and said, "daddy, he was nice to me!"&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The rest of the night went about as expected. We had pizza - each of the kids ate about 1/2 a piece. I made root beer by special request - unfortunately it didn't fizz up very well, so it wasn't all that popular. That was OK, because one of the boys found our stash of Mountain Dew in the basement pantry!!! Many a Nerf Gun war was had, both inside and out. Quin and I actually played with them for awhile. During one game, Quin cautioned us to "keep our eyes peeled." I'm guessing that's a phrase he picked up from the older boys!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As I dropped each of them off for the night after insisting that we were NOT going to be entertaining all of them for a sleepover (that didn't go over well - too much caffeine), all of the boys clamored out of the van at each stop, wanting to see each others houses. It was like herding cats to get them back into the van to make the next stop in a reasonable timeframe. I'm pretty sure it took an hour and half to deliver each of them home!!!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;All in all it was a nice party. It's always good to interact with a group of kids so you realize that yours isn't the only weird one - they're all weird!!! I'm happy that it is almost a full year until we will have another one, though! I suppose next year we'll be doing it for Quin, too!!!&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/7952050759151536460/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=7952050759151536460' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/7952050759151536460'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/7952050759151536460'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2011/05/ethans-10th-birthday-party.html' title='Ethan&apos;s 10th Birthday Party'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-4497396252409628132</id><published>2011-05-02T18:50:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2011-05-02T18:56:02.011-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><title type='text'>Not my friend...</title><content type='html'>Quinton has experimented with lots of different ways to express his anger with people when they don't do things he likes. Initially he liked to call people "poopy butt," but we quickly tried to squash that. He then moved on to calling people "stupid," which I think I like worse than poopy-butt. Lately he has categorized you as either his friend or not his friend. If he likes you particularly, or if he wants something from you, he tells you, "you're my best friend (he pronounces it fwond)." If, on the other hand, you tell him that he cannot have a candy bar after he hasn't eaten his supper, he says, "you're not my friend, Ethan's my friend." Of course, he will pick whoever else is around at the time, but you get the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I can't wait until he gets old enough to know what swear words are for...&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/4497396252409628132/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=4497396252409628132' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/4497396252409628132'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/4497396252409628132'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2011/05/not-my-friend.html' title='Not my friend...'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-392509239684607296</id><published>2011-04-06T11:33:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2011-04-06T11:35:50.439-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><title type='text'>More Adventures with Potty Training</title><content type='html'>So - potty training boys... Yeah... Well, we're still doing pretty well, but something new has reared its ugly head. Now that Quin knows when he has to go to the bathroom, and no longer does it in his pants, he has decided that he wants to find other things to pee on other than the toilet. Jenny caught him peeing in the bathtub the other day. Yesterday I stopped him from going in the garbage can and in the refrigerator, while Jenny caught him trying to spray down the plunger in the bathroom. I have to admit, I didn't see this one coming.

As of today, Quin is a week without diapers (while conscious). Last Saturday, Quin finally decided that he really, REALLY wanted to wear his light-up shoes all the time. He woke up on Saturday morning and told me, "daddy, I want my light-up shoes." I told him that he had to wear underwear if he wanted to do that, and he thought that was OK. Since then, it's been pretty much smooth sailing. Sure, he had a couple of minor slips the first couple of days, but overall it's been outstanding! On Sunday morning when he woke up, Jenny went upstairs to find him sitting on the toilet &lt;i&gt;pinching a loaf&lt;/i&gt;, so to speak. In fact, most mornings now when he gets up, the first thing he does is strip down and put something else on so he can wear his light-up shoes. One night I caught him with his shoes in bed with him! It's kind of nice that we really don't need to do a lot of potty training, we just have to find a bribe worthy of our kids training themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Still, one thing is eluding us. Quin still can't manage to make it through the night without causing a minor flood. He still has a diaper on at night, and he's OK with that. We're trying to figure out the magic to eliminating even that, but so far it seems impossible. By the time Ethan was potty trained he had been waking up dry in the morning with a diaper on. I can honestly say that has never happened to Quin. In fact, generally at least once a week he has wet through his diaper and leaked his bed. Our friends tell us we just have to grin and bear it with underwear at night - that sounds messy and hard...  Maybe next week.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For now, I will bask in the glory that is superior parenting with a quasi-potty-trained child. I realize it is crazy to take such pride in something that literally all children do, but I can't think of a time I've been more proud of Quin than I was last weekend. It really doesn't make sense, but then again, not much does with this crazy parenting thing.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/1952324973594525215/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=1952324973594525215' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/1952324973594525215'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/1952324973594525215'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2011/04/adventures-in-potty-training-again.html' title='Adventures in Potty Training - again'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-1802825405751474544</id><published>2011-03-20T21:06:00.004-05:00</published><updated>2011-03-20T21:24:32.819-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><title type='text'>Adventures in Potty Training</title><content type='html'>I hate potty training. Jenny does, too, for the record. We're no good at it. We rarely stay at home long enough to actually get our children into a rhythm of going every so often, we constantly forget to ask, and, well, it's just pretty convenient to not have to worry about one of the four bladders in our posse at any given time of day. That said, we have (finally) started attempting some degree of potty training with Quin... It's not going so well.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;To be fair, we've really only been at it for like 2 days. We took a page out of our "parental almanac" devised with Ethan and decided there are 2 things that work best for potty training: first, you wait until they are ready, and boys aren't ready until they are at least 3 (hey, it's true for one, it must be true for all of them, right?). Second, all children are motivated by cool shoes (please refer to the previous parenthetical sentence).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So part one of potty training is pretty easy - just don't do it until the age of three. Well, Quin's three now, so we are obligated to make sure that he doesn't have to go on his first date some day with a diaper bag. We also went out and purchased some pretty snazzy light-up shoes, the envy of all three year old boys.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As of tonight we thought we were doing OK. Unfortunately, we were going to be away most of the day at a Bucks game. No matter, a morning's worth of training is better than nothing, right? So he had underpants on all morning, no accidents whatsoever. We're geniuses!!! Along came his nap, however, and since he has NEVER woken up without such a full diaper that I'm afraid he would literally flood his room if he didn't wear one, we convinced him to put on some "nap underpants" just in case he had an accident. No problem, he acquiesced. While he was napping, Ethan, Jenny, and I left Quin in the care of our babysitter and went to see the Bucks downtown.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Five hours later (Milwaukee construction season has begun, so traffic is glorious, even on the weekend), we returned home, surprised to find Quin in his underwear, wearing his light-up shoes. The babysitter said that when he woke up, he made her help him go to the bathroom and put on underwear. He then proudly put on his light-up shoes. She told us that he had been to the potty three times already with no accidents. We are geniuses!!!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Fast forward another 2 hours, Quin is sitting at the table, watching the iPad, when I go over to him to ask if he has to go to the potty. He says no. He then sheepishly looks at me and says, "I went potty..." Sure enough, his pants were about as wet as if we had thrown him into the swimming pool fully clothed. Not only that, but a sizable pool of urine had collected beneath his chair. Nobody knows how long he sat there like that - but apparently our progress wasn't quite as great as we had hoped...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;One thing that has me a little worried about our potty training technique is the use of being a "big boy" as the reason he should be going to the potty. I think all parents do it, but each time I do it I feel a little bad. Am I completely ruining his self confidence? My guess is - no. Quin has taken to walking around the house, finding something that looks heavy, then lifting it up and proclaiming, "I'm skrong!." (He similarly mispronounces "skinky," as in, "Ethan take a shower - Ethan's skinky.") One of his favorite things to do is to torment Ethan by saying, "Daddy's skrong, mommy's skrong, Quinny's skrong, Ethan's like a baby." In Quin's world, "like a baby" is the biggest insult you can impart on somebody, or at least the one that you can get away with since we have demanded he stop calling people "poopy butt" or "stupid." Quin thinks he is so "skrong," in fact, that he is now proclaiming that he is a "superhero." Apparently his self confidence is intact...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'm sure Quin will one day be potty trained, and I'm sure once it happens it will seem easy in comparison to the challenges that are ahead with him, but for now, Quinton is winning the battles of the potty training war. Time to ferret out some more ammunition.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/1802825405751474544/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=1802825405751474544' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/1802825405751474544'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/1802825405751474544'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2011/03/adventures-in-potty-training.html' title='Adventures in Potty Training'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-4144579877240290190</id><published>2011-02-28T20:22:00.002-06:00</published><updated>2011-02-28T20:43:01.706-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Vacation'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Ski Vacation - Part II</title><content type='html'>&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Tuesday was another ski day. This time it was adult ski day. Quin was going back to school, and Ethan was enrolled in Woodward, an indoor extreme ski and snowboard school. The warehouse is immense with fake snow ramps that empty into foam pits and trampoline sections to teach people how to tumble with ease through the air. I think Ethan was in for a fun day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ethan and I went down to Woodward to drop him off while Jenny dropped Quin off at school. Apparently this day wasn't as easy to drop off as the previous - Quin really didn't want to go.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The ski day was relatively uneventful. We did a few black diamonds (for the ski uninitiated, these are rated as "most difficult," though there were plenty of runs quite a bit more difficult than the ones we did). All in all we skied for around 7 hours straight before packing it in and hitting the hot tub briefly before picking up our little boys.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ethan had a great time. He was one of only three kids on skis there, all the rest being on snowboards. He learned to do jumps, back and front flips on the trampolines, he went in the half pipe on the hill, and finally was able to do some woods skiing before all was said and done. Quin didn't have as good a time - too bad we are so lazy and he wasn't potty trained - once you are 3 and potty trained you can be in ski school which is WAY more fun. Maybe next time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The rest of the night we spent trying to eat and drink as much of the way too many groceries we brought up to the hill. Jenny met Maylee and the "younger generation" out at a Absinthe bar in the village while I concentrated on finishing out the beer in the condo.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Wednesday was a travel day - we packed our car and were on the road down the mountain by 10:00. We wanted to get some pizza in Idaho Springs, but it was too early when we went through there, and we weren't sure we'd have enough time to make it to the airport. Our flight was at 3:00.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Fast forward a few hours, the drive down went well. We stopped at a Target to use the bathroom, then had a minor adventure trying to find a gas station within 20 miles of the airport. We were able to return the car by 1:00, got on our bus back to the terminal, then grabbed some pizza in the main terminal before heading through security for the last time and on to our gate.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After getting to the gate, Ethan had some more homework to do, so Quin and I decided to tour the rest of the airport by way of the subterranean train. Our gate was on concourse A, so we took the train to C and walked through. On the way, Quin was propositioned by no fewer than three 30 year old ladies, flight attendants mostly. Two of them were going up the escalator while we were going down. He flirted incessantly with them, poor things. They asked if he would be their boyfriend to which he answered "yes." They asked if they could go home with him and he again told them "yes." To their chagrin, he had forgotten all about them by the time we got back on the train...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The flight back was quicker than the flight out, but Quin had a full 2 hour nap under his belt and was in no mood to sit still. Luckily we were on a Frontier plane where we could purchase DirectTV service for the kids. It went mostly without incident, though I'm pretty sure Jenny was ready for her afternoon drink by the time we were about 60 minutes into the flight.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We got home around 7:30, threw down some fast food, then rushed the kids to bed. We were right behind them after quickly emptying the suitcases into the dirty laundry baskets. It was a nice vacation.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Some random thoughts:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;It's easier to pack for a 6 day vacation where you fly than a 2 day trip to Neillsville. When you are taking a car, you can just keep jamming more stuff in. When you are flying, though, you have to be able to take all of your stuff in a single trip.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Quinton is "weawy skwong." Just ask him.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If something can be broken, Quinton can break it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;That's it for this year's kid trip. We don't have any other vacations planned for this year, so who knows when we'll take off for another adventure. When we do, I will for sure be here 'blogging it and blowing your mind with our whirlwind, exciting escapades!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/4144579877240290190/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=4144579877240290190' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/4144579877240290190'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/4144579877240290190'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2011/02/ski-vacation-part-ii.html' title='Ski Vacation - Part II'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-5554162672572734979</id><published>2011-02-21T16:56:00.003-06:00</published><updated>2011-02-21T16:59:16.331-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Vacation'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Ethan'/><title type='text'>Ski Trip - Interlude</title><content type='html'>OK, I hope this goes away like almost all other things, because if it comes back and is something serious, I will look like a schmuck.

He stood in the kitchen, looked at me, and said, "I hope this isn't something serious. It probably is, though.

Our first ski vacation in 7 years is in full swing!&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This vacation finds us in the beautiful US Rocky Mountains outside of Denver, CO. Though we're already settled and active in our vacation activities, the trip started many days ago. Last Wednesday to be exact. We had settled down for a typical evening at home - Quin and Ethan were sleeping soundly in their beds while Jenny and I attempted to get some last minute television in before our whirlwind trip to Colorado. All seemed normal, that is until 10:30 when Quin called out from upstairs. It's not atypical for him to wake up from time to time, particularly early in the evening. I slowly made my way upstairs to check on him. As I started walking down the hall, the door to his room opened and he walked out, covered in vomit. Awesome! Here we were, less than 48 hours from leaving for our trip, and Quin had come down with the flu! He was up the better part of the night, mostly dry heaving as he had done a pretty good job of emptying his stomach on round 1.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;By the time morning rolled around, Quin was feeling fine. Too fine, actually. We had to keep him home, but he was up and bouncing off the walls by 6:30 the next morning already! The good news is that, should any of the rest of us come down with whatever he had, it should be pretty fast moving...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Friday morning came without further incident. Our flight was at 10:30 in the morning, so we wanted to make sure we got out of the house by 7:30 to make time for getting gas and travelling to the airport. The commute couldn't have gone better - chalk one up in our favor! The roads were clear and traffic was light, so we were able to get to the ticket counter by 8:30 - no problem. Travel through the airport was fairly uneventful as well, which was a surprise. Quin has a tendency to run away. To give us peace of mind, we purchased him a "leash" disguised as a little backpack with a tether (yeah, it's a leash). Turns out we probably didn't need it, at least in the Milwaukee Airport, as Quin was so impressed by the whole experience that he stayed close the whole time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After some breakfast, a trip through the security line (regular metal detectors, no full body scans today), and a short wait at the gate, we were finally aboard the plane awaiting takeoff. This was both Ethan and Quin's second time on an airplane. It was the first time Quin was able to comprehend what was going on, though, as the last time was when he was only 5 weeks old. He was excited and a little scared, but he did great. He and I sat on one side of the aisle while Jenny and Ethan sat across from us. The boys bided their time on the airplane by utilizing many pieces of tech that are worth their weight in gold on a trip like this! Of course, at some point, a three year old's attention span is still a three year old's attention span, and Quin decided he had enough of sitting in one place. He had done so well for almost 2 hours, who could fault him for 30 minutes of ants in his pants?! After bouncing between our seats for awhile, he ultimately ended up in Jenny's lap for a nap for the last 15 minutes of the flight.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After the nice flight and uneventful landing, we started trekking through Denver International Airport. The tentative plans were to land at 12:30, be in Denver for lunch by 2:00, check into the hotel, maybe swim for 30 minutes, then head up to Boulder for the beer festival. Ha, funny!!! By 2:00 we had finally gotten our luggage and made it to the rental car outpost. Things just take longer when you have kids along. At one point, I changed Quin's pants after him having sat in them for 6 hours - he was wet. No more than 10 minutes later he had filled them again... By 3:00 we had finally gotten to the restaurant for lunch (note that is 4:00 our time, lupper anyone?), we did check into the hotel by around 4:00, but there was no time for swimming. I had purchased a ticket to the Avery Brewing Company's 9th annual Strong Ale Festival, which started at 5:00 in Boulder, a 45 minute trip in good traffic. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So, immediately after checkin at the Holiday Inn Select at Cherry Creek, we got into our red Toyota Corolla rental car and headed out for Boulder. The 1.5 mile trip down Colorado Blvd. took a little longer than expected. We were on that road for 30 minutes! We did manage to get to Boulder by 5:30 and I attended a wonderful beer festival! So many beers that I had never tried, and true to the title, they were all strong. In fact, the prerequisite to have a beer at the festival was that the alcohol content was 8% or better. My company has an office in Denver, so I was able to meet up with one of the guys from that office along with his family which made for a less lonely beer festival overall. Surprisingly I saw many people from Wisconsin with whom I started up some casual conversations. All in all, it was a lovely 2 hours spent.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The original plan for the beer festival was to drop me off, have Jenny drive the kids back to Denver for some swimming, then come back to pick me up for the 9:00 closing time. After the hectic, traffic heavy drive, however, Jenny didn't feel too comfortable that she would be successful in this venture, and I agreed. So we compromised - I shortened my night to 7:30 (more than enough time) and she took the kids shopping for the consumables we would be charged through the nose for on the mountain. That worked better...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When we finally got back to the hotel, it was around 9:00 Mountain time. Quin still hadn't had much for a nap, Ethan was tired, I was tipsy, so we got in bed and went to sleep. Unfortunately, that is not where the adventure ended for me that evening. I'm not 100% sure that I didn't drink "too much," but I've had some experience judging this in the past, and I felt I stayed well within my limits on this particular occasion. Rewind two days to when Quin was up puking all night before the vacation - I'm pretty sure that's what I caught. After an hour spent on the bathroom floor, I felt marginally better - well enough to sleep. Jenny woke up with the kids the next morning, took them swimming, got them breakfast, and by 8:00 I was feeling like I belonged among the living again. Again, I'm pretty sure it was just the flu!!!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We checked out of the hotel fairly early on Saturday and went over to Maylee's apartment to await the caravan up the mountainside to our condo. Checkin time wasn't until 4:00, so we had a fair amount of time to wait. Quin and Ethan bided their time climbing on the dog fence outside Maylee's apartment while Jenny joined Maylee, her sister, and her mom to get some groceries.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;By 2:00 we were ready to drive. After spending over 3 hours at Maylee's apartment, we were happy to get moving again. However, we weren't gone for more than 5 minutes before Ethan claimed he had to go to the bathroom! As we drove down Colorado Blvd passing gas station after gas station, Ethan was wondering loudly why we wouldn't stop to let him go to the bathroom. So I took a page out of my vacation past and handed him an empty water bottle and told him to fill it up, explaining that we were in a caravan and couldn't just stop and go to the bathroom. To my delight, he managed to tackle the task with vigor, filling it 1/3 of the way to the top, even though it took him quite a while to overcome his "stage fright."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The drive up was uneventful. It was snowing lightly once we passed through the Eisenhower tunnel. Our luck seemed to continue as the weather called for a winter weather advisory for later in the evening, a prediction that partially came true. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We arrived at the condo a little after 4:00 and settled in. The condo is very nice. Two stories with a kitchen, spacious living room with a fireplace, and a bathroom on the first floor, and a master bedroom, loft bedroom, and bathroom on the second floor. More than enough room for the 4 of us! &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After unpacking and laying claim to sleeping arrangements, we headed out to check out the town. The Winters had purposely booked this time of year for vacation due to the "En Fuego" party that they were having. En Fuego, according to the signs, is Spanish for "Good Times at Copper Mountain," or something to that degree. The village was lit by bon fires. At 6:30, they had fire dancing courtesy of "Cosmic Fire," which was a troupe of three young people that apparently had no fear of close proximity to flaming objects. After about a 30 minute show, they started a 15 minute firework display to finish off the evening.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After that we basically went back to the condo, had a beer, and Quin and I went to bed. Not sure what other fun happened after 8:00 because I was out for the count. The nice thing is that when Quin woke up at 6:00 the next morning, I had 10 hours of sleep already!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As Sunday morning dawned, we were looking forward to getting Quinton into something more structured. Daycare opened at 8:30 sharp, and apparently they mean 8:30, because we were there at 8:27 and we were unable to check him in. Too desperate? After dropping him off, getting Ethan's rental skis, and obtaining our lift tickets, we were out on the slopes. It felt great to be on an honest to goodness hill for the first time in a long time. I had no idea how long it had been until Jenny and I took an assessment on the way up the hill one time. The last time we had been on a "mountain" run was at Copper Mountain 7 years ago! That's too long...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The skiing was great. There was several inches of powder snow from the previous night, which I'm told is great. For us flat landers, it was challenging getting our legs used to skiing on anything other than ice, and on something that took more than 45 seconds to ski down! By the second run, all three of us (Jenny, Ethan, and I) were feeling very comfortable and excited about what we were doing. I will admit, I felt more than a little nervous on several occasions as Ethan caromed down the hill with what looked like absolutely no control whatsoever. When later challenged, he admitted he had absolutely no control! By lunch time, however, we were all looking like the solid intermediate skiers that we knew we were!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We took in a nice lunch at Endo's Adrenaline Vault in Center Village. Ethan had maybe the largest peanut butter and jelly sandwich ever made! After lunch, we took on a couple more runs before panic struck. Ethan started getting a headache. It wasn't long before he was diagnosed, by both Jenny and himself, as being dehydrated. Much like the previous day, we were no more than 20 minutes from lunch and Ethan needed to stop because he didn't have enough water in him!!! We finally convinced him to do 2 more runs and then we'd head back to the condo for some rest. The first run went fine, but the second was maybe the most tragic skiing incident I've ever been a part of. There was plenty of sobbing and threats to throw up. The poor woman that rode the lift with us offerred to give him a stick of gum and some sage advice to drink water, but nothing was making him feel better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We finally made it back to the condo around 2:00, which turned out to be plenty of time skiing the first time in so long! We left Ethan to rest on the couch while Jenny and I took in some hot tubbing with the Winters.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After picking up Quin from daycare, we settled into the condo lifestyle for a couple of hours - Ethan recovering, Quin playing, and Jenny and I trying to hold all of it together while planning dinner, baths, and whatever else adults have to do. At one point we were invited to the Winters for a drink, though Maylee was in the village at Endos again. I offered to let Jenny go there to spend some time with her, which she "reluctantly" took me up on. While she was gone, Ethan convalesced from his sickness so the three of us had some dinner, gave Quinny a bath, and hunkered down to watch X-Men Origins: Wolverine. As the movie was winding down around 7:30, Quin sat on my lap and fell asleep. Vacation's hard!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Jenny finally made her way back, hungry and a little tipsy, by around 8:30. She dug through some of our leftovers of mac and cheese and hotdogs from supper while Ethan and I prepared our evening's entertainment. The owners of the condo have a collection of old movies on DVD. One of the movies looked interesting. It was called "Copper Mountain" and starred Alan Thicke and Jim Carrey. The description looked promising, so we decided to give it a try. Wow. I can now say I have viewed the worst movie ever made. At 60 minutes, it was about 55 minutes too long! It makes most porno movies I've seen look like Oscar candidates!  There was nothing we could do to top that experience, so we decided to head off to bed after that...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Monday morning rolled around. It was our planned day off from skiing, so we decided instead to do some sightseeing instead. After breakfast we headed into the village to get Jenny and I some caffeine and the kids some doughnuts. It was a little brisk, so we headed back to the condo and enjoyed some relaxing downtime through lunch.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After lunch, Ethan and I went tubing in the East Village. I wasn't convinced going into it, but it turned out to be a blast. We took a video which I intend to link to here once I get it uploaded. That takes us to now - as I sit here "blogging," Quin is enjoying a nap, Ethan is relaxing while watching "The Rookie" on TV, and Jenny is enjoying some more hot tubbing. Tonight looks to be relaxing and low key before tomorrow's adventures - Quin is going back to day care, Ethan is enrolled in "Woodward," a school that teaches kids how to do tricks on skis and snowboards, and Jenny and I have the slopes in our sights, this time without kids. For now, though, I have to concentrate on getting rid of the enormous amount of food and beer that we bought for this trip so I don't feel bad about leaving so much of it behind.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/5932330511373608824/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=5932330511373608824' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/5932330511373608824'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/5932330511373608824'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2011/02/ski-trip-part-i.html' title='Ski Trip - Part I'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-4295034218237205471</id><published>2010-12-29T10:58:00.001-06:00</published><updated>2010-12-29T11:00:12.410-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Dancing'/><title type='text'>Dancing Quin</title><content type='html'>This video is hilarious, I think.

Last week we went skiing for the first time this year.  Since Alpine is close to some friends of ours, we were able to meet up with them and their two kids, one of which, Justin, is Ethan's age.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Justin and Ethan were having a blast!  Justin snow boards, but Ethan skied.  Of course, as soon as he saw Justin snow boarding, he immediately wanted to try that.  Jenny tried to convince him that he would want to do that prior to us going, but he didn't want to until he saw Justin doing it...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;They spent most of the day in the terrain park.  Jenny, Jeff, and I hung out with them when they would allow us, but we were by far the oldest people in the terrain park by double or more!  Jeff said he likes to get the kids in the terrain park because it enhances their vocabulary.  Indeed...  I'll give Ethan credit - even though he lacks in style or skill, he has no fear on the hill.  He was taking every jump he could take.  Him and Justin would brag to each other about how much air they got and if they "landed it."  Ethan proclaimed that he "must have had 6 feet of air" at one point.  Below is video proof of the feat.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/s2ii3H4VZTo?hl=en&amp;fs=1"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/s2ii3H4VZTo?hl=en&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/4765276154049504151/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=4765276154049504151' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/4765276154049504151'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/4765276154049504151'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2010/12/6-feet-of-air.html' title='6 Feet of Air'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-7689827726724213155</id><published>2010-12-07T19:55:00.002-06:00</published><updated>2010-12-12T11:14:10.827-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;div&gt;As I said before, we're re-doing the kids' rooms.  Quin's is slowly morphing from a baby's room to a boy's room.  The first step was a new bed, but first we had to get rid of the old one.  After taking the crib up to Grandpa and Grandma Grady's house, and not yet having a replacement, we opted to put the mattress that was destined for the room on the floor.  Quin slept great on it!  One small quirk, though.  When he goes to bed, he likes to have the ceiling fan on as high as it goes and he likes to put the covers over his head.  In the interest of time, I oblige him each time.  Hey, it's an easy way to get him to bed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;One of the more interesting Quin tendencies lately that forces us to pay attention to him pretty much every second of the day is his desire to climb on the railing surrounding the staircase.  I'm not talking about the inside of it, but the outside, the side that hovers precariously 10 feet above the bottom step below.  The first time I caught him doing it we were painting.  He called out to me to "look at me," and I calmly crapped myself as I extricated him from the wrong side of the stair railing.  This one is a challenge!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Like another time, over Thanksgiving, Quin was playing with my keys.  Jenny and I both said, "that's probably a bad idea.  We should get those away from him."  Well, good intentions being what they are, we spent the next day and a half trying to find the now lost keys.  We had to call Brett in Janesville to make a special trip to Oconomowoc to get the spare so we could get home.  I even replaced the keys to the tune of $100+!!!  My mom spent the better part of the last two weeks looking for them...  Should have listened to my own advice.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;To follow up, the keys were finally located - last night!  They turned up in the snack tray which was safely tucked away in the cupboard for the last several weeks.  Apparently the gigantic feast we had for Thanksgiving obviated the need for snacks the remainder of the weekend.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/7689827726724213155/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=7689827726724213155' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/7689827726724213155'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/7689827726724213155'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2010/12/as-i-said-before-were-re-doing-kids.html' title=''/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-4901158995680906306</id><published>2010-11-29T19:35:00.006-06:00</published><updated>2010-12-09T21:43:37.849-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Christmastime</title><content type='html'>Wow, it's been a long time again!  I hope to post multiple times this week to get caught up. So much to talk about!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it started a few weeks ago with Quin getting sick. The sickness eventually spread throughout the house but Quin got it first. The poor guy was just listless, throwing up, no fever, but sick. Every time he threw up over the course of several hours he just did it over the bucket, no crying or anything.  He was fine the next day, but now he constantly tells us that he's going to go "throw up." &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several days earlier (or later, I can't remember), we were repainting Ethan's room. We're actually redoing both boys' rooms with new beds and the lot. One night when Jenny had finished painting, she put Quin to bed, left one of the roller trays to dry, then went downstairs to clean up the brushes. Apparently little sweety decided to help out as when I got home from my cub scout meeting I found a little treat on the wall, trim, and carpet. He had gotten out of bed, taken one of the clean brushes and used it to apply some of the drying paint in the roller try to the "wall."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More to come...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/4901158995680906306/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=4901158995680906306' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/4901158995680906306'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/4901158995680906306'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2010/11/christmastime.html' title='Christmastime'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-4376667685576180877</id><published>2010-10-22T07:47:00.003-05:00</published><updated>2010-10-22T07:58:37.048-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Ethan'/><title type='text'>Pre-puberty...</title><content type='html'>My relationship with my oldest son seems to be changing quite rapidly of late.  This morning after getting out of the shower I noticed a can of Axe body spray sitting on the sink intended for me.  &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Let me rewind a little bit - over the past couple of months it has become evident to us that we had "the stinky kid" in school.  Ethan would get into the car, or just walk near us, and you could certainly tell he was there!  Not wanting to be the parents with the stinky kid in school, we racked our brains to fix the problem.  We tried buying him deodorant, we tried making him scrub extra hard on his every other day shower, but nothing seemed to really be working.  Finally, fed up, Jenny laid down the law and mandated daily showers along with a strict regiment of male fragrances.  He was resistent at first, but eventually he came around, so now he is a daily showerer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Fast forward to the Tuesday, Jenny went out and purchased Ethan a bottle of Axe body spray, Dark Temptation variety.  For some reason unknown to me (perhaps I am the stinky guy at work), she also purchased a bottle for me, but got me the Fever scent.  Over dinner last night, Ethan and I were discussing the finer points of wearing our different scents.  He really enjoys his, as do all the guys in his class (the girls are less impressed, apparently) while I was not a big fan of "The Fever."  So Ethan agreed to let me try his Dark Temptation the next day, which is today.  He made sure he gave me detailed instructions of where to spray it and in what quantities.  "No more than a second or a second and a half.  Like this."  At which time he mimed spraying the fragrance on his chest and stomach...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ah, puberty is going to be fun.

We pretty much just got up and left first thing on Sunday morning.  It was looking like a very hot day, and the time we did spend outside packing the cars found us swatting at a lot of mosquitoes which had been very sparse the rest of the week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of interesting things happened during the week, but here is a quick summary of some of the more memorable things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I lost my wedding ring (still haven't found it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Quin learned to swim with a life jacket&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- We vacation with a very good mix of kids that get along with each other very well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Matt's boat started on fire on Saturday&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- We learned that an unopened bottle can explode when introduced to heat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Chantrelle mushrooms are quite delicious&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Ethan learned to filet a fish (not filet-o-fish)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'll be publishing the vacation photos in the coming weeks, so keep an eye out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Posted using BlogPress from my iPad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class='blogpress_location'&gt;Location:&lt;a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Prairie%20Dr,Oconomowoc,United%20States%4043.031455%2C-88.475567&amp;z=10'&gt;Prairie Dr,Oconomowoc,United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/5172045879977782067/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=5172045879977782067' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/5172045879977782067'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/5172045879977782067'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2010/08/st-germain-summary.html' title='St. Germain - Summary'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-1643513929003013149</id><published>2010-08-29T19:40:00.007-05:00</published><updated>2010-08-29T19:40:20.044-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>St. Germain - Day 7</title><content type='html'>It was my morning to get up with Quin.  He didn't go to bed until 10:00 last night, so it was a bit of a surprise when he got up at 6:00 like normal.  Luckily I just convinced him to lay down and within about 10 seconds he fell back to sleep until 8:00.  By that time his diaper was a wreck!  I was changing the mess that had accumulated saying something about "stinky poop" or something, and Quin said "I poop potty."  I asked him, "really?"  Quoting a perfect Donkey from Shrek he said, "Really, really."  Chalk another one up to nurture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was looking to be windy and warm today, so we decided to go take in a game of mini golf before it got too hot.  We played at a nice course called the 19th hole, or something equally as cleverly named.  Ethan had a blast and Quin even tried to join in much to Jenny's and my chagrin.  He played my ball for the first 7 holes and Jenny's for the remaining 11.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After golf and some lunch, Quin took a nap and the rest of the kids went swimming.  I was actually afforded some time to read my book which I had ignored to this point in the trip.  It's not a bad book if you are able to read more than like 2 pages at a time!  After about 90 minutes of reading, though, Quin woke up and I was taxed with taking him swimming.  This time, however, we just kind of let him go himself.  He had no problem just getting into the water with his life jacket on and swimming out to the raft where he joined the rest of the kids and swam for almost 2 hours!  I can't imagine Ethan ever doing that at that age, but then again, we were pretty guarded parents with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At some point, just jumping off the raft and swimming got boring for the bigger kids - one of them had the bright idea that they would sink the paddle boat!  It was pretty hilarious!  They worked on sinking that thing for over an hour and had a blast doing it.  I think Ethan said at one point, "we should have been doing this all week!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When swimming was complete we gathered around and did a little fishing.  Quin put a pole in and actually caught a decent size perch!  He told me he wanted to kiss it before I put him in with the rest of the fish we were going to eat, but got scared at the last minute and decided not to go through with it.  He did make friends with some dead minnows, however.  While I was cooking the meat on the grill, Quin took a dead minnow over to the canoe, gently set him in the front seat, then walked to the middle of the canoe and said, "ready fishy?"  I'm pretty sure he was going to take the minnow for a ride.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dinner, and pretty much the whole afternoon was dedicated to mass consumption of all the stuff we hadn't yet eaten or drank from the week.  Matt fried up all the week's fish, we put some ribs on the grill, Tim and Laura sauteed some mushrooms that they had found in the woods, and we had a big, delicious meal.  After the kids went to bed, we continued on the same theme but with the remaining beer.  Matt, Tim Z., and I all managed to complete all of our beer before we left the fire that evening.  I'm pretty sure Tim A. would have as well had we not almost blown ourselves up.  Tim Z. was digging through his cooler to bring out the dregs of his drinks and came upon an O'Dools.  Nobody really wanted to drink it, so he placed it, unopened in the fire.  After a couple of minutes it started to whine.  After a few more, it started to whine louder, which prompted all of us to get up and vacate the immediate area around the fire.  It couldn't have been 10 seconds too soon because as soon as we cleared about a 10 foot radius the bottle blew!  It was quite impressive - a large crater had formed at the center of the fire, firewood had been thrown in all directions (luckily it was a small fire), and burning embers surrounded the fire-ring for around 10 feet.  There was no sign of the bottle that I could see, though the color-sighted people said they did find shards of it in the ground around the fire.  After that episode, Tim A. wisely decided it was time for bed.  The rest of the guys made a huge fire and talked smartly about how we should do that again - we didn't...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Posted using BlogPress from my iPad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class='blogpress_location'&gt;Location:&lt;a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=St.%20Germain,%20WI&amp;z=10'&gt;St. Germain, WI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/1643513929003013149/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=1643513929003013149' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/1643513929003013149'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/1643513929003013149'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2010/08/st-germain-day-7.html' title='St. Germain - Day 7'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-3716984732295577525</id><published>2010-08-29T19:40:00.005-05:00</published><updated>2010-08-29T19:40:15.036-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>St. Germain - Day 6</title><content type='html'>Last night was an early one - we were all pretty beat from 5 days of vacation, so by 10:00 pretty much everybody was in bed already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today started warmer, but still windy.  After Jenny and I each had a run we ran into town to get some chai tea and a smoothie.  We then ventured into Eagle River to hit the liquor store.  All that took a surprisingly long time.  By the time we got back it was lunch time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a quick lunch of leftovers, we got our swimming suits on and hit the water.  Today Quin proved himself to be quite the brave kid once again.  Early in the week he proved he could jump off the swimming raft by himself with no problem, but I was still in the water with him.  Today he proved that he could do even that by himself.  He learned to propel himself through the water by himself and hung out with the other kids without Jenny or I being in the water at all with him!  It was weird with Ethan when we could leave him alone and he would play either by himself or with some other kids, but he was a bit older than Quin was today when we were able to let him do the same.  Second kids...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little later on, Jenny and I decided to take the kayaks out with the kids and do a little kayak adventure.  Unfortunately Ethan wasn't quite up to the adventure.  It was a little warm, and he was wearing a black swim shirt, so after we kayaked for a little while, he claimed he was overheating and had to stop.  At one point he stopped and the waterworks started up because he was too hot to go on.  Quin and I drove by him and splashed him to try to cool him off a bit.  I think he was really just a little over-vacationed by this point and needed to hang out by himself for a little while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After we dropped Ethan off to recover from his heat exhaustion, Quin found himself a kayak and decided he would pilot it himself.  It was beached on shore, so he shoved it out into the water by himself, then climbed in it, procured the paddle, and tried to take off.  Luckily the wind was blowing in pretty hard so he couldn't get very far, but it wasn't for lack of trying.  I think he actually kept at it for over 45 minutes before he turned his attention elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the night wore on, the Ziegler's and us decided that preparing dinner yet another night was more than we were prepared to do, so we trekked into Minoqua to try out some local pizza.  Neither Quin nor Tim's kids had napped that day to speak of, so within about 10 seconds of the 20 minute commute they were all sleeping.  Normally that would be OK, but we didn't leave until about 5:30 so the 7:30 bedtime was looking precarious at best.  We got some delicious pizza for the adults and spaghetti for the kids before coming home and commencing the long process of fighting Quin into bed - it was 10:00 before he finally went down for good.  We will need some time to re-acquaint ourselves with a schedule when we get back home!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Posted using BlogPress from my iPad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class='blogpress_location'&gt;Location:&lt;a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=St.%20Germain,%20WI&amp;z=10'&gt;St. Germain, WI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/3716984732295577525/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=3716984732295577525' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/3716984732295577525'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/3716984732295577525'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2010/08/st-germain-day-6.html' title='St. Germain - Day 6'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-41598393758281498</id><published>2010-08-29T19:40:00.003-05:00</published><updated>2010-08-29T19:40:07.732-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>St. Germain - Day 5</title><content type='html'>Still a little cool to start the day, so Quin and I made bacon and egg sandwiches for breakfast before we headed out fishing with Tim and Logan Ziegler.  The fishing wasn't all that great, but we did have a close encounter with an eagle.  It was pretty awesome, actually.  We heard something heavy in the trees, then the eagle flew just above the water not more than about 20 feet from the boat.  He skimmed the water across the lake, picked something up, then reversed his path and came right back past us again.  He perched up in a tree and ate whatever he picked up in the lake.  Thinking back on it I couldn't help but think about the double rainbow guy on YouTube.  I had thoughts of me saying, "An eagle!  What does it mean?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After some lunch, Ethan and I went out on the boat with Matt, Jacob, and Devan on his ski boat and did some tubing.  Ethan really enjoyed tubing.  We weren't able to get him outside the wake, unfortunately, but he had a good time anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the afternoon sort of passed.  We did some kayaking, some canoeing, tried to find the eagle again.  In all it was pretty uneventful.  Right after supper, Quin and the rest of the "gang" started playing in some round tub that somebody had brought up.  That was pretty funny watching them get in and roll each other in the bucket.  It's amazing what kids will do when left to explore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remembered the funny quote of the week - I think it was by Jenny last night.  She was trying to convince Ethan to take a shower.  He was claiming that he was on vacation and didn't need to take a shower.  Jenny told him, "You don't get a vacation from personal hygiene."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Posted using BlogPress from my iPad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class='blogpress_location'&gt;Location:&lt;a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=St.%20Germain,%20WI&amp;z=10'&gt;St. Germain, WI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/41598393758281498/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=41598393758281498' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/41598393758281498'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/41598393758281498'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2010/08/st-germain-day-5.html' title='St. Germain - Day 5'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-1426165591632540515</id><published>2010-08-29T19:40:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2010-08-29T19:40:01.899-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>St. Germain - Day 4</title><content type='html'>It was windy and cool today, and I am training for a 1/2 marathon, so I picked today to do my long run of the week.  I mapped out a route before we left that took me around the entire lake.  While I was supposed to run only 10 miles, the prospect and symmetry of running around the entire lake was too good to pass up, so Tim Z. and I ended up running a little over 11.5 miles.  It took us a long time, and it was hilly, but we did it.  I now feel I'm ready for the 1/2 in a little over a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it was so windy, we started a fire early.  We also decided to roast hot dogs on the fire for lunch, which are always more delicious than hot dogs on the grill or in the microwave.  Ethan even went so far as to say they tasted as good as Uncle Brett's hot dogs, which is not faint praise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After lunch, it was time for a shower and to dress warmer.  After my shower, I went to put my wedding ring back on which I had taken off for my run, only to find that I could not find it.  I'm still not sure what happened to it - I think Quin must have taken it off the table and thrown it on the floor.  Hopefully it turns up somewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the topic of naughty Quin, he has developed a new, interesting routine while up here.  He has been doing things that he knows are naughty, which really isn't all that different.  Where his behavior is changing is that he will look at us after the deed is done and say "Sorry daddy, hug!" followed by a nice hug and kiss on the cheek.  Hard to be mad at him when he does that, but if thinks we don't see through him, he's crazy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was too cold to hang out outside, and our cabin a little too small to hang out there for too long, so we took a journey into Minoqua for some shopping and to make our daily pilgrimage to the grocery store.  It was largely uneventful, though the weather did seem to improve a lot while we were there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we got back, the weather had, indeed improved, so we quickly ate some supper and hung out by the water while we waited for rest of the families to eat.  The kids started playing with the sand toys and being generally loud and annoying, as they tend to do.  Somewhere in the mix, Ethan went back to the cabin, put a towel in his shirt and a sweatshirt on his head and paraded around telling everybody that he was a woman...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We finished the day on a nice pontoon boat ride, courtesy of Micky's parents who came up for a few days and were nice enough to bring their boat.  Tim A. drove the boat and was nice enough to let several of the kids to drive.

That didn't last too long, unfortunately.  At about 1:30 we heard somebody talking to us through our window - it was Micky telling us that Jacob had gotten sick and that Ethan was now feeling sick, so she was returning him to us for the night.  So much for that idea...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By morning, Ethan was feeling fine.  It was rainy and a little cold today, so we went up to the U.P. to check out a waterfall up there.  It was pretty awesome.  Bond Falls, it was called (I think).  One really neat thing about it was all the trails around the falls.  They had some permanent, wood trails built that gave you very good access to the entirety of the bottom of the falls.  They then had some "off road" trails you could take up the side of the falls on one side, and a paved set of stairs on the other side.  Ethan found his way up the non-paved side and made us all follow him, but it was worth it.  What views!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We quickly ate some lunch then headed into town for some go-karting and mini-golf.  Ethan had been looking forward to this all year.  Last year we tried to go go-karting but Ethan was foiled by the fact that he was about an inch or two too short to drive the cars himself.  He was sure that he would be tall enough this year.  Sure enough, he stood next to the measuring line and was clearly tall enough to pilot the go-kart himself.  He was smiling from ear to ear!  He couldn't wait another minute to go on the go-karts, but this place was a little bit of a strange establishment.  They had plenty of different go-karts, bumper boats, mini-golf, and other assorted kid's stuff, but nobody was really on anything, and there wasn't anybody manning all of the different appliances.  So we first took Quin over to a kiddie track that offered 12-volt 4-wheelers and gators for the smaller kids to drive.  Ethan was starting to get impatient, but it wasn't long before somebody finally came over to the "big-kid go-kart track."  He was first in line and managed to get onto the track with Tim and Jacob in one car and Micky and Allison in another, just the three cars on the track.  Ethan did very well - I was both proud and surprised.  After getting off the track he immediately took another ticket and did it again, this time Quin and I also rode with him.  Our car was pretty slow, and Ethan took full advantage and passed us at his first opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the second bout of go-karting on the regular go-karts, Tim A. asked if anybody wanted to try the "slick track" with him.  Ethan immediately volunteered.  After somebody finally came over to that station, he took a look at Ethan and said, "he's not tall enough."  We simply looked at him and said, "of course he is."  Well, that didn't convince him, so he made him stand next to the measuring line.  Apparently the minimum height on this ride was 54" rather than 52", but Ethan backed up to the scientifically measured line and very slyly stood on his tip-toes, just a little bit.  Apparently the kid running the ride wasn't all that bright because he just shrugged his shoulders and said, "OK."  The slick track was pretty cool and Ethan immediately picked up on how to turn the opposite way of the turn when you started to spin.  Pretty cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The night finished out like all nights up here - put the kids to bed then went to the fire for some beers before hitting the hay ourselves.  Tonight, however, Jacob decided he wanted to sleep over at our cabin.  That worked out just fine for awhile.  While at the fire, around 10:00 or so, we saw the lights go out in the cabin signaling that the kids had finally decided to turn off the movie and try to sleep.  It wasn't 5 minutes before Jacob exited the cabin and headed towards his own cabin.  He claimed that his mom would miss him too much if he slept in our cabin, and he didn't have a sleeping bag with him and he couldn't sleep without one.  Oh well, 0-2 on the sleeping over attempts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Posted using BlogPress from my iPad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class='blogpress_location'&gt;Location:&lt;a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=St.%20Germain,%20WI&amp;z=10'&gt;St. Germain, WI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/7914576728868293162/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=7914576728868293162' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/7914576728868293162'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/7914576728868293162'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2010/08/st-germain-day-3.html' title='St. Germain - Day 3'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-6992324700826158862</id><published>2010-08-29T19:39:00.003-05:00</published><updated>2010-08-29T19:39:49.359-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>St. Germain - Day 2</title><content type='html'>Day 2 was a lazy day.

I had neglected to pack anything - Jenny packed all the kids' stuff as well as mine, but there was still a pile of things that I needed to take care of the morning of our departure.  My parents, Blaine, and Brett along with respective lady friends of each of theirs joined us the day prior to celebrate mom and dad's 39th wedding anniversary by going to IrishFest in Milwaukee.  It was a good time, but afforded us a little less "last minute" packing time than normal.  I thought we would be fine as long as we just packed in the morning...  It seemed Karma didn't want us to leave, for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I had about 4 ounces of root beer extract in the refrigerator waiting to make another batch of root beer.  This stuff must be the messiest stuff known to man - I think it was probably easier to clean up Chernobyl than it was to clean up the 1/2 ounce of this stuff that is still smudging up our refrigerator.  I put about 40 minutes into cleaning it while Jenny tended to some other things, but by the time I was ready to quit, there was still a bit of the stuff left coating the fridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After packing the car and putting away the lawn mower, I went into take a shower, feet covered with grass clippings from the freshly mowed lawn (another thing we had to scramble to do).  As I was showering I noticed the water steadily climbing in the tub - looks like we had a clog.  Thankfully it was just a slow leak, so we decided to leave it and address it when we got home.  Hopefully we remember.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We finally got out the door, but the trip's string of bad starting luck wasn't done yet.  We were traveling with one of the Johnson's kids because they were borrowing a boat to bring up for our entertainment for the week.  About 20 miles from home, their luck took a turn for the worse when the wheel on the trailer blew.  They were able to put the spare on, but had to spend the next 3.5 hours in Madison getting new tires for the boat trailer they borrowed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully we finally made it to our destination in time to enjoy a wonderful first day.  Thoughts of our earlier misfortunes evaporated quickly as we soaked in the sunshine and beautiful lake views we were able to enjoy for the remainder of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Posted using BlogPress from my iPad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class='blogpress_location'&gt;Location:&lt;a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=St.%20Germain,%20WI&amp;z=10'&gt;St. Germain, WI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/8186199888513351441/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=8186199888513351441' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/8186199888513351441'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/8186199888513351441'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2010/08/st-germain-day-1.html' title='St. Germain - Day 1'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-1321797566874998353</id><published>2010-07-12T09:37:00.003-05:00</published><updated>2010-07-20T21:56:34.445-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Ethan'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/TEYvlgHylcI/AAAAAAAAA40/s0-3tZ7v-PE/s1600/ethanSkiis.png"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 208px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/TEYvlgHylcI/AAAAAAAAA40/s0-3tZ7v-PE/s320/ethanSkiis.png" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5496132716576544194" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Last weekend, our friends Micky and Tim, who live on a lake and have a boat, invited us over to their house to go for a boat ride.  Ethan has wanted to try skiing all summer - so now was his chance.  Thanks to a lot of help from Micky and Tim's instruction, he was able to lift himself from the water on his third try!  Not only that, he was able to do so two more times after that as well!  Way to go E!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethan and I share a lot of personality traits.  One of the most pronounced, and perhaps annoying traits (according to his mother) is our love of Weird Al Yankovic.  Ever since I introduced Ethan to Al's spoof on Lola by The Kinks he has been hooked.  How could we resist when we found out that Al would be playing Summerfest in Milwaukee.  Forget that it was a "school night," and that he didn't start playing until 9:00 PM, we were going!  We all had a great time - Quin slept from the start of it all the way through.  Ethan watched a lot of it on my shoulders, until my shoulders gave out and he had to settle to look at people's backs for a little while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Lastly, Quin had a milestone of his own the other day.  He was taking a bath - before the bath he said he had to go potty, so I put him on there and he peed - he generally does.  After being in the bath for a couple of minutes, though, he told me he had to poopy.  So I dried him off and put him back on the toilet.  I'm used to this game, he generally sits there, does nothing, wipes his butt, and flushes the toilet.  This time, though, he grunted and pushed and birthed a small little Mr. Hanky into the toilet.  He was so proud, but immediately had to get up and flush it down because it was "ucky."  After he flushed, though, he got back on and pinched another one off, again following that with another flush.  I think about 6 or 7 flushes later I convinced him he was done.  He's followed this up on 2 other occasions, though Jenny and I have really not yet started to "potty train" him...&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/1321797566874998353/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=1321797566874998353' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/1321797566874998353'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/1321797566874998353'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2010/07/last-weekend-our-friends-micky-and-tim.html' title=''/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/TEYvlgHylcI/AAAAAAAAA40/s0-3tZ7v-PE/s72-c/ethanSkiis.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-7212884341437879049</id><published>2010-07-06T22:02:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2010-07-06T22:10:08.375-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Ethan'/><title type='text'>Quick Hitters</title><content type='html'>&lt;div&gt;The other day we were at a party where we stayed pretty late.  On the way home, Ethan engaged us in interesting conversation, as always.  I can't remember the exact context, but he asked something about somebody and if they were "a black."  We told him that it was not appropriate to refer to somebody as "a black," it could be insulting.  Instead he should use "black person," or better yet, "African American."  He took this in stride and continued on with his conversation.  After we got home, I was upstairs putting him to bed, when he asked me, "Dad, is it OK to call myself 'a white?'  If I do that, am I insulting myself?"  I had to tell him that I honestly didn't know...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After Quin's driving incident, one would think we would no longer let him behind the wheel of a car.  Tonight he fetched me, took me by the hand, and brought me to Jenny's car, where he instructed me to get in the passenger's seat and buckle my "beatbel (seatbelt)."  I asked him where we were going, and he said "work."  He is quite obsessed with going to work, apparently.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;One thing I find amazing about Quin lately is his memory.  Jenny is a bit of a Chai Tea Latte addict.  When she has Quin on Fridays, there is a better than good chance that they will go to Starbucks and she will get a latte while Quinny will get a donut.  On Monday we were driving in Delafield, a place we don't go very often, and Quin saw a Starbucks, which prompted him to shout, "Donut, yeah!!!"  I'm not sure if he was remembering a time when Jenny took him there, or if he has learned to recognize the sign - normally they go to the Oconomowoc Starbucks...  Either way, I'm pretty impressed.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/7212884341437879049/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=7212884341437879049' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/7212884341437879049'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/7212884341437879049'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2010/07/quick-hitters.html' title='Quick Hitters'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-1805595253690179278</id><published>2010-05-30T23:25:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2010-05-30T23:40:52.782-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><title type='text'>Baby Driver</title><content type='html'>"They call him baby driver."  My dad used to sing that song to us when we were young.  I don't know if I ever heard the real version, but I remember it almost as well as him saying "wake up and piss, the world's on fire."  Anyway, I digress...&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It's been a busy spring here at the Grady house.  So busy, in fact, that we really haven't had time to do any yard work besides the required lawn cutting so far.  This past weekend, that was about to change.  The weather was nice, we were going to be home for a whole day after ditching on our original plans to be in Neillsville for the whole weekend, (we opted for an up and back on a single day trip instead), so the stage was set.  Jenny went out and bought some annual flowers to plant in the various places throughout the yard.  Ethan's and my job was to obtain some mulch and fill in our weedy, mulch-bare flower beds.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My plan was sound.  In year's past we have had mulch delivered and dumped in our driveway.  We would then spend the next couple of weeks shoveling it into a trailer behind the yard tractor, driving it to a flower bed, then shoveling it out of the trailer.  Why waste all that time?  This year I was planning to just get as much as would fit in my pickup and drive that on the lawn to the beds - the ground is dry and compact anyway...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Step 1 almost failed miserably.  Ethan and I got in the truck, buckled in, and I turned the key to find the battery was once again dead.  Something wrong with the truck...  No matter, I will give it a jump and we'll be on our way.  And indeed, that minor setback proved to be just as minor as I would have thought.  In order to let the battery charge a bit, though, I decided to leave it run while we had the load operator load up our 3 yards of mulch and while I went into the office to pay.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Back at home, the plan continued to work just fine - I drove the truck to the various beds around our front yard (the goal for the day) and unloaded mulch directly from the truck to the bed - 1/2 the work of the normal method!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After my first three beds, the truck seemed to be losing some steam again.  I don't know cars very well, but I figured that I should probably let it run and let the alternator do its job and charge the battery.  So I figured I would do just that as I finished the 4th and final bed of the day.  Prior to moving to that bed, however, Jenny informed me that she was going for a run and that Quin would be working with me for the next hour.  No problem.  Quin climbed into the truck cab with me and sat on the bench seat beside me as I maneuvered the truck onto the street and back onto the yard near the fourth bed.  Quin loves the truck, so I decided it would be easiest to just let him play in there while I prepped and filled the bed.  What's the worst thing that could happen?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I started to edge and weed the bed, every so often looking back to see what Quin was doing.  Remember, though, that I was leaving the truck run so it could charge the battery.  Well, at one point I looked behind me to find the truck slowly moving towards my neighbor's house!  The truck being a 1990 model, it was not yet equipped with the safety feature of requiring the brake to be depressed before putting it into gear!  I remember being quite annoyed by that "feature" on more than one occasion, but now I see the logic!  Anyway, I rushed to catch the truck, flung the door open, knocked Quin out from behind the wheel where he was grinning and doing his best truck driver impression, and finally engaged the brake just as we were about to hit the trunk of Harry's pine tree!  Honestly, I was pretty lucky Quin decided to steer in a slight arc to the right, because if he would have kept the wheel straight, he would have almost certainly hit the side of Harry's house right where the gas main comes in!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Moral of this story - always engage the parking break if you are letting your 2 year old play in a running vehicle...  Of course, on a 1990 truck, I'm guessing that wouldn't have prevented a damn thing...&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/1805595253690179278/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=1805595253690179278' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/1805595253690179278'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/1805595253690179278'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2010/05/baby-driver.html' title='Baby Driver'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-6777600333251154453</id><published>2010-05-01T10:12:00.003-05:00</published><updated>2010-05-13T21:27:37.495-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Ethan'/><title type='text'>Lots of new words, and the Amish</title><content type='html'>&lt;div&gt;Quin's been quite the learner the last few months.  I think since our vacation in April he's been picking up an average of a couple new words a day.  He has his favorites, though.  My latest favorites are "nan" which means "dance," and "nonut," which means "donut."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Quin has a definite love of dancing.  He has figured out how to turn on various CD players and radios throughout the house, and once they are on, he will come and grab one of us to come and "nan."  Today he figured out how to turn on Jenny's iPod and was "nan"ing to that.  Not surprisingly, he's the best dancer in the house.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He's also a sucker for "nonuts."  The other day Jenny started the bribery phase of parenthood with Quin by telling him that if he was good for the YMCA daycare people, she would buy him a donut.  He was good, so she kept her promise and bought him a "nonut" at Starbucks.  The next day, we were on our way to Neillsville and swung through Starbucks to fuel up.  Even before we got into the parking lot, Quin started chanting for a "nonut."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Some of his advances have come in the form of sentence formation.  The other day Ethan asked for a bowl of cereal as a snack (his favorite).  Quin, of course, needs to have pretty much anything Ethan does, so he wanted some cereal as well.  I got him a bowl and put some Cookie Crisp in it for him.  He looked at it, looked at me, then pointed at the cereal and said, "cereal toostie," which of course means that the cereal is thirsty.  I poured some milk on it and he was happy.  Of course, he didn't really want milk on his cereal - he just saw Ethan had milk on his.  Instead of eating it, he poured it on the floor...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Quin is a very helpful person to have a round almost all the time.  He always wants to help regardless of what I'm doing.  It's pretty rare, though, to have Ethan interested in helping.  Last week I was tending to some yard work, planting, raking, watering, etc.  Ethan was outside, and apparently had gotten in some trouble with Jenny earlier in the day, so he decided he was going to help to try to get back in her good graces.  I happily obliged him, putting him to work.  After about 30 minutes of straight work, he said to me, "Dad, we're working so hard, people are going to think we're Amish!"  To give just a little background, we recently purchased some woodwork from an Amish businessman in the Augusta area (no, they don't have a website).  While we were there we pointed out to Ethan that there was an Amish boy about his age, and that he didn't have a DS or all the toys he had, and that they worked really hard.  Apparently working really hard to Ethan means spending 30 minutes holding a hose and rake one night a year!!!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/6777600333251154453/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=6777600333251154453' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/6777600333251154453'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/6777600333251154453'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2010/05/lots-of-new-words-and-amish.html' title='Lots of new words, and the Amish'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-3259798919853344823</id><published>2010-04-11T19:13:00.004-05:00</published><updated>2010-04-11T20:30:29.143-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Vacation'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Vacation 2010 - April 9 - 10, Driving</title><content type='html'>We drove...  A lot...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We left mom and dad's place by 7:15.  After a Starbucks run to keep the monster in the passenger's seat happy, and a stop at the gas station for some gas and an energy drink (to keep the van and the monster in the driver's seat happy), we got out of town by 7:45.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not much to talk about here - we lunched at a Dairy Queen in Gallup New Mexico after passing through our first timezone.  There were many, many Native Americans there - the only non Native Americans were us and some old bitty behind the counter who took all her orders on a waitress pad then punched them into the register...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We stopped for dinner in Tucumcari at a truck stop.  They were announcing shower customers over the intercom which kind of confused Ethan until I explained that they were in their trucks more than we were in our car for this week!  While we were there, a crazy looking old guy with fatigues and a long gray beard walked in, sat next to us for a few minutes, then packed his stuff up and started to leave.  That was before Quin started up a conversation with him, that is.  As scary as he looked, he was tickled pink to talk with Quin and started telling us about his grandchildren...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Tucumcari we went off the Interstate and headed north.  It was dark when we went through, but we were warned about the cattle fields by my parents.  I could see a big dust cloud ahead, and once we reached it, we could smell what it really was.  I can only imagine what it looked like, but I thought I was going to die from the smell...  All in the name of cheap burgers, I suppose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We finally arrived in Dodge City, KS at 1:00 AM Central time - we had passed through 2 time changes and touched 5 states on that day's drive...  We stayed at a Best Western on Wyatt Earp Drive which was a very nice hotel...  Sleep came quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning we let the boys swim and got a little breakfast before hitting the road by about 10:00 Central.  The drive was pretty boring today.  Lunch in Wichita, which contrary to what you might think, is not actually a state, even though there is a college named Wichita State University...  At that point we got back on the Interstate, a tollway as it turned out, which cost us $8.25 to travel on for about 2 hours...  We quickly went through Topeka, Kansas City, and finally stopped in Des Moines for the last time.  We ate at a familiar restaurant, Culvers, and we felt like we were pretty much home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 hours later, we were finally home.  It was 1:00 AM Central - we were on the road 30 hours and 20 minutes including breaks the previous two days and had traveled almost 1800 miles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a great trip, much better than I expected it to be - it usually is.  I suppose I am a cynic when it comes to traveling with my kids, but they were, overall, fantastic and fun to travel with.  To sum up, here are some parting statistics and random thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In all, we traveled 4063.7 Miles over the course of 64 hours 37 minutes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;We traveled in 11 different states of these United States, Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Missouri.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not all states are created equal - Arizona is beautiful, Texas and Oklahoma, not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Iowa has very nice rest stops and roads&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There's no place like home!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/3259798919853344823/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=3259798919853344823' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/3259798919853344823'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/3259798919853344823'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2010/04/vacation-2010-april-9-10-driving.html' title='Vacation 2010 - April 9 - 10, Driving'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-3161481508371472549</id><published>2010-04-08T18:59:00.004-05:00</published><updated>2010-04-11T20:16:13.395-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Vacation'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Vacation 2010 - April 8, Apache Junction</title><content type='html'>We started the day off again with a run through the Usery Recreational Area.  This time we knew where we were going, but that didn't make it any less exciting.  We saw three hares (I believe that's what they were) and a roadrunner.  Jenny was attacked by a cactus which waylaid us for a few minutes, but overall it was a nice run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After spending several days with Quin, he seems to be getting smarter all the time!  No doubt it's because of the extra exposure to me!!!  Anyway, I thought it would be a nice aside to go through some of Quin's latest quotes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When Quin wants something to drink, he says "My toostie," which loosely translates to "My Thirsty."  Anything can be his thirsty, including something that you though was your drink...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When Quin does something, anything, he may look at you and say, "I did it."  No doubt about what he's saying here.  On the ride home we were treated to a variation of that.  He would take off his shoes and socks while riding in his car seat and say, "I did it (pause) mommy."  He would keep saying that until Jenny would look at him and tell him he did a good job.  He would then move on and say, "I did it (pause) daddy."  Same drill.  Finally he would end with, "I did it (pause) E."  E is how he says "Ethan."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If Quin wants something open, he hands it to you and says. "Ope."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If Quin wants to put something in his pocket. he hands it to you, grabs his pocket, and says, "Pock."&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;However, if Quin is stuck or something he wants is stuck, he says, "uck."  There seems no rhyme or reason to why some words are truncated at the end while others at the beginning...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sometimes Quin just sings or talks to be talking.  Often it will be some variation of&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;"Daddy... Helloowww."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;We were able to get into the pool on this particular morning after Jenny and I did our run/Starbucks ritual.  The Superstition Butte (that's the park mom and dad live in) pool has some odd rules, most constricting is that kids can use it only from 10AM to 1PM.  No biggie, we went at 10:00.  However, some of the other rules are a bit concerning.  For one, you aren't supposed to use the pool under the following conditions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;You are incontinent&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have a skin disease&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have diarrhea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You may be contagious&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You have leprosy...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;OK, I made the last one up, but they didn't give you a lot of good reasons to want to use the pool...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After lunch we went out in search of some outdoor activity.  We ended up at a mini-golf course in Mesa called Golfland.  Quin started out sleeping, but was awake enough by the time we started golfing and decided that he was going to play as well!  Grandma won the round with the lowest score, so we made her buy us ice cream at Baskin Robins before heading back to the park to prepare for our big night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The evening brought us to the Arizona Opry, a dinner show not too far from my parent's place.  The place was filled with Arizona types, and by that I mean oldies!!!  Dinner wasn't my family's cup of tea, roast beef with gravy, mashed potatoes (also with gravy), vegetables (gravy optional), a roll, apples, and chocolate cake (no gravy on this one).  I liked it...  The dinner really isn't what it's all about, though - it's only a reason for them to charge you as much as they do for the show.  The show is where the real fun starts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The "music master" is a guy named George Staerkel.  This guy could do it all!  I couldn't figure out what his main instrument was since he played so many.  He played keyboard on many songs, but wailed on the trumpet and various other brasswind instruments, was solid at many different varieties of saxophone and other reed instruments, and also played a respectable Swiss Horn while circular breathing.  None of that was really quite as impressive as how well the guy could sing, though.  He actually toured with a group called "The Tokens" in the 80's when they were doing a revival tour.  They were the band that had the hit "In the Jungle" back in the 60's or 70's (I can't remember which - maybe the 50's).  Anyway, he was pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the band was almost as impressive.  Few played only a single instrument and they all sang.  It reminded me a bit of some of the shows in Branson when we went there a couple of years ago.  Ethan had a blast, Quin was a very good boy, only needing to be removed from the performance one time, and it was a 2 hour performance!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/3161481508371472549/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=3161481508371472549' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/3161481508371472549'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/3161481508371472549'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2010/04/vacation-2010-april-8-apache-junction.html' title='Vacation 2010 - April 8, Apache Junction'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-8452003284578061736</id><published>2010-04-08T18:44:00.007-05:00</published><updated>2010-04-11T21:59:26.609-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Vacation'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Vacation 2010 - April 7, Apache Junction</title><content type='html'>It was nice to be somewhere that we didn't have to be running all the time!  To celebrate, Jenny and I went for a run!!!  I had made it out in Denver for a quick 3 miler, but Jenny wanted to get out, so we went to the map and found somewhere that "looked like it had trails."  After driving for about 10 minutes, we found a trailhead at the Usery Recreation Area and parked.  We didn't have the $2 entrance fee for the self service registration, so we took all my dad's change (we took his car), $1.45, put it in the envelope, and hoped for the best.  It was a nice run, but a word to the wise when running in the desert - if a trail has the word "wash" in it, don't run on it!  We ran almost a mile on a trail called the Amigo Wash, which turns out to be a dried creek bed.  It was like running on a beach!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After consulting the iPhone for the nearest Starbucks, we went back, got some breakfast, and relaxed a bit.  My dad and I went out to run some errands and to get my tire fixed, Jenny, my mom, and the boys hung out at mom and dad's place and took a walk.  After lunch, we finally got motivated to go somewhere, a shopping center south of Apache Junction called San Tan Shopping Center (or something like that).  The main attraction was a little store called "Total Wine and More."  It is basically a toy store for alcohol enthusiasts.   They have something like 4000 wines, 2000 spirits, and 1000 beers.  It was like sensory overload!!!  I ended up spending just south of $20 on bombers and bottles of things I can't get in Milwaukee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We then stopped quickly at Best Buy in the same shopping center where I was able to fondle an iPad for the first time.  It took all my will power, well, all of Jenny's insistence for me to walk out of there without one!  I will have one, some day...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We finally ended up at a ghost town outside of Apache Junction called Goldfield (I think) to do a bit of touristy stuff.  We first rode the "choo choo," followed by some ice cream, and finally Ehan and I did a horse ride.  It was pretty cool, actually.  It was the first time I was allowed to control a horse while on a ride rather than just getting on a "horse train."  Ethan was also able to ride his own.  He rode Bear and I rode Captain.  The 30 minute tour took us through national forest and desert land.  Our guide was full of interesting information, like the fact that Arizona had one of the lowest percentages of privately held land in the nation, only 18%.  In fact, he said that you could ride all the way from where we did our tour up to Utah without hitting a town or leaving public land.  Interesting...  Bear and Captain were great, too.  Ethan had his hands full with Bear who liked to stop and munch on desert grass he found, while Captain seemed to like nothing better than to smell Bear's butt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For future study, we learned just a little bit about the "Lost Dutchman," who was apparently some guy that buried a bunch of gold, up to 9 pounds or something, in the Superstition Mountains, which is the mountain range outside of Apache Junction.  I didn't catch the whole story exactly but put it here so you can do your own research and to remind me to look into it later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After taking supper in (my parents were leaving the same day we were for Wisconsin in the offseason and had a lot of food to get through in their refrigerator/freezer), Jenny and I got dressed up and went out on our own!  As usual with vacation, we were too tired to do anything all that exciting by the time we actually got out.  We ended up going back to San Tan, browsed through Barnes and Noble, groped an iPad at the Apple store, then had a brownie and beers at Gordon Biersch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Man, even the "off days" are packed full of activities!!!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/8452003284578061736/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=8452003284578061736' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/8452003284578061736'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/8452003284578061736'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2010/04/vacation-2010-april-7-apache-junction.html' title='Vacation 2010 - April 7, Apache Junction'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-2524368900998144824</id><published>2010-04-07T13:16:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2010-04-07T13:16:20.901-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Talks with Ethan.</title><content type='html'>It sometimes frightens me to think what Ethan tells people about us.

Oh well, maybe I'll get some comments from my wife and parents to help fill in the blanks.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Qunny got up &lt;i&gt;early&lt;/i&gt; this morning!  5:00 AM.  A 5PM afternoon nap of 90 minutes didn't help us out here at all.  We tried to push him over to Grandpa and Grandma's room right away, but he didn't want to have much to do with that.  At one point Jenny and I were so mad at him that I took him out to the van to let him cry it out.  Eventually Jenny was able to take him over to breakfast and let Ethan and I sleep for a little while longer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The continental breakfast at the hotel was pretty good.  After some food, we headed back up to the canyon to check out how it would look in full sunlight.  The day was cold, but it was sunny, which was nice.  Predictably, the canyon looks completely different in full sunshine.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We didn't stay long, though.  By 10:00 we were heading down 64 to 180 towards Flagstaff with Sedona our interim destination of the day.  The trip from Tusayan to Flagstaff was quite breathtaking.  One thing that's nice is that all speed limits are 10 miles per hour greater than Wisconsin, so even though we were on 2 lane highways, the speed limits were 65 miles per hour.  But the trip - now that was something else.  Up and down, windy roads, but we traveled between two mountains, so we saw lots of different terrain.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After getting some gas and directions, we continued south to Sedona.  Now that is a drive!  Sedona is only about 25 miles south of Flagstaff, but the terrain couldn't be different than that of Flagstaff and locales north.  The rocks turn red and you descend several thousand feet almost instantly.  The road is so windy and steep that it takes about 45 minutes to make the trip.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We stopped in Sedona quickly for lunch.  The place has grown quite a bit since we were there in 1994.  There were shops there then, but the shops seem to have multiplied.  It was difficult to get around with all the tourists walking around.  It looked like Wisconsin Dells in peak season!  Now maybe I'm being romantic, or maybe the fact that we were there in the middle of January made it seem  more quaint in 1994, but I have to admit it was a little disappointing.  The landscape was still just as impressive, though.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;On the way out of town we stopped at a roadside trailhead to attempt an assault on Chicken Point, a 1.5 mile hike from the road.  The rocks were breathtaking, but the terrain seemed more difficult than the NGS employee lead us to believe.  The trail was very rocky and had a lot of up and downhill traverses.  Ethan found a lot of rocks that he enjoyed climbing on, and Jenny and I enjoyed getting back to something close to the hiking we used to do back when we lived in Washington back in the late 90's.  Quin enjoyed his backpack that we purchased in Denver for him...  When we finally got back to the parking lot, we realized that we took the wrong trail!  I'm kind of glad we did, though, as this trail was much more interesting than the one we eventually discovered was the correct trail.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We finally left the Sedona area and headed towards Phoenix around 4:00.  Directly after getting into the car, I asked Jenny, nervously, where my phone was.  For some reason I had a feeling that I had left it on the van roof before we left.  I located the phone quickly, however, and we continued on.  About 10 miles later, I got a call on said phone from my parents who were driving behind me.  My mom asked if my wallet had somehow fallen out of the car.  She thought Quin had thrown it out of the window.  I looked down to where I had been storing my wallet and noticed that it was gone, and my mind immediately went back to when we pulled out of the parking lot.  I had set my wallet on top of the van and forgot to retrieve it before we left!  Somehow it stayed there for 10 miles while we drove!!!  We pulled off the road, did a U-turn, and traveled back about a mile where my dad somehow located my wallet in the middle of the road.  After retrieving it from highway traffic and returning it to me, I discovered that a credit card and another card were missing from one of the compartments.  We walked up the road a ways where I caught a glimpse of something on the road which I quickly identified as my credit card.  After two cars passed by, it was blown to the side of the road where I was able to retrieve it, slightly damaged.  The other card was an XBox Live recharge card which I paid $35 for and inexplicably haven't activated yet, so I was half ready to leave it.  For some reason, however, I decided to look the other direction from the car to see if I could somehow find it.  Sure enough, I caught it out of the corner of my eye on the other side of the road.  I crossed, two more cars passed, and the card was blown to the side of the road again.  So as far as I can tell, all of the contents of my wallet are accounted for after I had left it on the roof of my van while driving down the highway!  How's that for luck!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The remainder of the trip to Apache Junction was blessedly uneventful.  We arrived at mom and dad's place around 6:30.  It's a very nice and surprisingly big place in a retirement park in Apache Junction.  There seem to be hundreds of these retirement parks down here!!!  After unpacking our car I realized that the left-front tire looked a bit low.  I measured the pressure which was at 15 pounds...  Have to check that out in the morning.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We were quick to bed this evening after the day's activities.  Not much to do the following two days which is just fine!!!&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/239392110035386023/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=239392110035386023' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/239392110035386023'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/239392110035386023'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2010/04/vacation-2010-april-6-sedona-and-apache.html' title='Vacation 2010 - April 6, Sedona and Apache Junction'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-2802003205064917859</id><published>2010-04-06T23:59:00.005-05:00</published><updated>2010-04-07T01:05:51.453-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Vacation'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Vacation 2010 - April 5, The Grand Canyon</title><content type='html'>Busy day, this one.  We woke up after "sleeping in" until 6:00 at the Hampton Inn in Flagstaff, AZ.  Very nice hotel, reasonably priced, with a nice rooms, decent continental breakfast, and most importantly, a POOL!!!  After Quin woke up, he and I went downstairs for some fruit, cereal, and juice.  Jenny and Ethan joined us shortly afterwards.  After we were sufficiently fed, we got into our swimming suits and took in some much deserved swimming.  We had the place to ourselves, which was nice since the kids are extremely loud!  I'd say we swam for at least an hour this way.  Ethan has become a very good swimmer and really enjoys the water.  He particularly likes when I launch him into flips, but we can only do that when nobody else is in the water.  Quin thinks that he can do anything that Ethan can do, but still can't swim.  He really enjoys jumping from the edge of the pool into the water - not really jumping to me, but into the water.  I still catch him, though...  He hates that!&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;By 10:00 we were wheels up and on our way to the Grand Canyon.  The first order of business was to feed the Starbucks need, though.  Using my trusty iPhone we located a Starbucks no more than 1 mile away.  During that short drive, we could already see that today was going to be interesting.  That pervasive wind from the day before hadn't subsided.  In fact, it seemed to be gaining in strength!  I really hate wind, even more so when I'm trying to work out.  With that in mind, my mind was completely blown when I saw a biker huffing his backside up the mountain we were driving up.  It was 40 degrees (a generous exaggeration) with wind gusts up to 50 miles per hour!!!  Some people are cut from a different cloth, I guess.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;With caffeine desired satiated, we headed up Highway 89 towards the Grand Canyon.  About 75 minutes later we crossed Highway 64 and headed west towards Grand Canyon National Park.  I've been to the park 2 times in the past.  Once with my family on a vacation in the early 90s, and once with a school trip in the late 90s.  Both times I visited probably added up to 30 minutes of looking at the park, so I was looking forward to this opportunity to spend some real time here.  We were optimistic that the weather forecast was all wrong, too, as the car thermometer read 65 degrees, though it was still windy as hell!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Our first stop along 64 was prior to getting into the park, a little place called Little Colorado River Gorge.  We parked there and were immediately blown away, literally, by the wind.  We hadn't really been out of the car to experience the full force of the wind yet, and it was brutal.  It was so bad that two of the port-a-potties actually fell over.  Here's the picture to prove it!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/S7wZBwyKK-I/AAAAAAAAAws/MiBJzb9LMnU/s1600/IMG_0230.JPG"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/S7wZBwyKK-I/AAAAAAAAAws/MiBJzb9LMnU/s320/IMG_0230.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5457264366532045794" /&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); "&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Anyway, this viewpoint, along with most others east of the canyon, was lined with Indian craft salesmen.  We wound our way through the sales tents to find our first glimpse of the canyon, and man was it spectacular.  This particular vista was of a far east locale but had a great view of the Colorado River.  Well, it could have been the Little Colorado River, I'm not sure, but it was awesome.  Unfortunately, I started to feel guilty and a little nervous that we had left Quin in the van, which by now was over 500 meters away, because he was taking a nap.  So I took what I refer to as the "Glen Grady tour of the Canyon, 35 seconds and out" and headed back to the car.  Luckily he was still sleeping peacefully in the van.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We continued west towards the park proper.  At regular intervals we would pass views that exceeded the last ones we saw, all from the car.  We did the same things that we remember our parents doing to us on trips like this, we kept urging Ethan to look out the window at how beautiful that was!!!  He was happily playing his Nintendo DS, though, in what I'm sure he'll remember when he's 37 years old!!!  It's refreshing and frightening at the same time to realize that we're turning into our parents!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As we continued to drive, we noticed that the weatherman was getting more and more accurate.  The temperature, a respectable 65 degrees at our first stop, had dropped to 50 over the course of about 7 miles.  We eventually entered Grand Canyon National Park's east entrance and stopped at the first vista, the Desert View.  We all got out of the car this time, Quin in his new riding backpack, and the rest of us on foot, to take in our first real look at the Canyon.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'll spare the gory details, but to sum it up, Jenny and I took around 400 pictures of the canyon.  It seems that every time you move 10 feet, it completely changes.  We tried feebly to capture the awe we felt by snapping all of those pictures, but I'm sure they won't quite translate.  If you've never visited, visit.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Our stay at Desert View lasted about 1 hour, already doubling my previous two trips to the canyon.  We were able to walk up the Observation Tower, an 80 foot high structure that was undergoing some repairs.  At the top, the view of the canyon looked much the same, since it is so damn far down there in the first place!!!  It was a bit nerve wracking going up there as I realized they were tracking the width of the cracks in the wall, no doubt hoping that the structure wouldn't fall down.  One thing we noticed immediately were all the foreign visitors to the canyon.  Many people from Asia and Europe were populating the park.  Man, that makes our little driving excursion seem small by comparison!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We stopped at a couple more vistas and eventually wound our way around to Tusayan, AZ just south of the park where we were to meet my parents who have recently relocated their winter headquarters to the Phoenix area.  This was the first time the kids have seen them since Christmas, and the reunion was precious.  I was a little worried about how Quin would react to them, but he did not disappoint, giving big hugs and kisses to both of them, especially Grandpa!  Boy does he have a thing for his "bompas."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After an overpriced cafe lunch, we went back to the park with mom and dad for some quick glimpses of the big crack before we finally returned for our pre-planned tour of the canyon, a sunset jeep tour.  Our guide was Mike, a foreign (I say British, my dad says Australian) guy of advanced middle age who knew lots of interesting information about the canyon and its surrounding forests.  The tour would take us through the Kaibab National Forest and back into the park.  Along the way, Mike filled us with little known facts about the park and surrounding forests.  Some of bits I remember include:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In order to control overgrowth, the forestry department allows anybody to come into the Kaibab National Forest and, for a $20 permit, take 4 chords of wood.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A chord of wood is 4 feet by 4 feet by 8 feet, a volumetric measurement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are trees in the national forest that are 350 years old and older!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Hopi and Navajo people both held residence in the Grand Canyon in the past, and at the same time.  One was a subset of the other, but I don't recall which.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They use mules to trek to the bottom of the canyon because horses are too skittish (though mustangs might be able to make the trip) and donkey's are just too stubborn.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Last year, 22 people died in the canyon.  3 from dehydration, 3 from suicide, and 16 from tragic accidents near the edge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you lose your footing near the edge, the next time you are likely to touch something is 300 feet later.  That fall is rarely survived.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;After 2 hours and several stops, Mike, who incidentally looked a lot like my uncle Al, brought us to where we were to watch the sunset.  We were 30 minutes early, but the weather was already starting to roll in.  He kept saying that the weather can change in a heartbeat there, but eventually conceded that it was not going to this evening.  We were able to leave early just as the snow started coming down!  All in all it was a great tour despite the fact that we did not get to see the sunset.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After our "early" departure from the tour, we were finally admitted to the hotel (long story, I'll post it later if I feel bored, or just ask me over a beer sometime - let's just say the cleaning crew must be very sparse at this hotel).  While the kids enjoyed their grandparents for awhile, Jenny and I ventured out to get an overpriced pizza from the Pizza Hut Express in town.  We then scarfed that and various sundries we had brought along for the trip while watching Duke eek out a victory over Butler in the NCAA basketball championship game.  After that, Quin hung out with Grandma and Grandpa while Ethan, Jenny, and I went to the main lodge to take in some video games and some bowling - yes, they have bowling at this hotel.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Traveler's Tips&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;If going to the Grand Canyon and you don't plan on doing spending more than a day, stay in Flagstaff or elsewhere.  Tusayan and the GC Village are just too expensive - the lodging, the food, the fuel.  We would have probably have been much better off just staying at the Hampton Inn another night and driving back after our tour.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Grand Canyon can be cold!!! Pack for all occasions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you can, spend a couple of days at the Canyon and do one of the hikes, not just around the rim, but into the canyon itself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The "Canyon Walk" that you've likely seen on TV with the horseshoe glass walkway out over the canyon is NOT at the Grand Canyon National Park.  That structure is somewhere 250 miles west of the park and was built by a Native American Group.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gas in Flagstaff is actually more expensive than the smaller surrounding communities!!!

Bear with me.  April 4, Easter Sunday, was a day of driving.  I was actually able to get out of bed and get out for a 3.4 mile run in the crisp Denver morning (41 degrees but sunny).  Running in Denver is nice and not so nice.  Nice because they have so many running trails and there are so many cute girls that are generally out exercising as well (even when it is cold).  Not so nice because it is the "Mile High City" and that seems to play tricks on either my mind or my lungs or both.  The first 10 minutes of this run was brutal!  After that, though, I settled into a nice, slow trod and was able to complete the run.  A couple of "interesting" things I saw on the run - there were a bunch of old men out walking their equally old looking toy dogs, there was a guy that lived in the city that had outfitted his little postage sized lot of land into looking like a farm, complete with 3 classic tractors that he appeared to enjoy working on, and there was this one spot on the trail where somebody had spread out a bunch of bird seed, no doubt meant for birds, but was being hoarded by a group of wayward squirrels that were afraid of nothing!&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We managed to get out of town at 10:00 AM and met little traffic immediately.  The travel south of Denver was quite nice through Pueblo.  We made a quick stop in Pueblo to let Ethan go to the bathroom.  I had initially intended to stop there, but we were a bit early and Quin was sleeping, so we called an audible and decided to move on.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We finally stopped for our Easter lunch in Weisenburg, CO, which looked like the next largish town on our way.  We saw a sign for Subway and decided to get subs and have a picnic in a town park.  Not much went right with that plan.  When we got to Subway, it was closed for Easter, so we settled for roller dogs and chips from the Loaf 'n Jug.  We still attempted a picnic, but after about 10 minutes had to leave because the wind was blowing so hard!  So much for Easter lunch!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The remaining travel south to New Mexico went without incident.  We hit one major milestone, the car passed 100,000 miles!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Another 5 hours of driving and we made it to Albuquerque, NM, our intended supper destination.  The plan this time was to get something decent to make up for the roller dogs.  However, a bid to hit a Best Buy to get Ethan a new DS game took us WAY off course - there was no Best Buy, and we ended up settling for KFC and a much nicer park than lunch for supper.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The remainder of the trip was uneventful.  We finished the trip at 10:30 local time, 12.5 hours after we left.  Mileage was close to 800 miles, but I don't remember for sure.  A couple of brief observations:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;- Driving through New Mexico is like watching Cars.  I kept wondering when I would see Radiator Springs.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;- I wonder why they would build Route 66 right along the I40 interstate.  I mean, why take that meandering route if you could go straight through!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;- I saw a sign that said "Indian Tacos" on the way through western New Mexico.  I wonder if that is code for a reservation bound brothel...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'm a day late on today's post now, but am tired and need sleep.  I will hopefully be able to post two tomorrow, but will likely get lazy and just do two lame posts or one longer posts that cover our two days in the Grand Canyon area.  Time will tell.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/5033336429017793189/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=5033336429017793189' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/5033336429017793189'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/5033336429017793189'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2010/04/vacation-2010-april-4-driving.html' title='Vacation 2010 - April 4, Driving...'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-22830981492804539</id><published>2010-04-05T12:27:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2010-04-05T12:28:54.856-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Grand canyon</title><content type='html'>Holy crap it's windy!!!  Short post for now. Jenny and Ethan are out looking at the little Colorado river gorge about 15 miles east of the south rim park of the grand canyon. It's not too cold out but I bet the wind is gusting up to 50 mph. It's so bad that it tipped over 2 portapotties. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quinny is napping. We left him in the car to start with but then felt guilty so now I'm hanging out with him. We are heading over to the main park in a couple of minutes and will post a full recount along with pictures later. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Post From My iPhone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class='blogpress_location'&gt;Location:&lt;a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Unnamed%20Rd,Cameron,United%20States%4035.918950%2C-111.563525&amp;z=10'&gt;Unnamed Rd,Cameron,United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/22830981492804539/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=22830981492804539' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/22830981492804539'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/22830981492804539'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2010/04/grand-canyon.html' title='Grand canyon'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-6294685685561237338</id><published>2010-04-03T23:14:00.003-05:00</published><updated>2010-04-03T23:48:48.469-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Vacation 2010 - April 3, Denver</title><content type='html'>OK, back to the standard keyboard.  Too much to write to try to do it on my little iPhone.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The day started out pretty early this morning.  Quin woke up around 5:00 local time, but that was OK with me since I had fallen asleep last night at 8:30 local.  Of course, in a single bedroom apartment, once anybody is up, everybody is pretty much up.  By 6:30, everybody was done pretending to be asleep anymore and we got up and ready for the day.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ethan started his waking day by playing Wii Fit with the balance board.  It was pretty fun.  He ended up the hoola-hoop champion even though I showed him how to do it!  Once we were all ready, though, we left the apartment and were off to meet Jason for some breakfast, but not before going first to the mall to check out the line for the Apple iPad launch!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;OK, I fall for these things time and time again.  I convince myself that I need one of these things as soon as they come out, then I get there and realize that I have no interest in standing in line for a couple of hours while I wait for the privilege of paying them to give me one!!!  I did the same thing with the XBox 360 before realizing how dumb I was and waiting a whole week before I got one...  Anyway, we were able to manage a Starbucks run out of the whole ordeal.  There were many people in line at the Apple Store.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We left the mall and headed out to our breakfast destination, the Village Inn, which is right next to Best Buy.  I happened to know that each Best Buy was allotted 15 iPads for launch and I saw only 4 people in line, so I am pretty sure I could have gotten one there, but breakfast beckoned, and I ultimately decided I could wait (again).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Today's big destination was the Denver Zoo.  It's a pretty nice zoo and will be getting nicer as they complete a huge new project called the Asian Exchange (or something like that).  It appears to be a very large project, taking up an entire border of the zoo.  Quin and Ethan enjoyed themselves, Quin especially loved the "choo-choo."  Ethan was interested in getting through the Zoo in time to see the movie I had promised him, "How to Train your Dragon."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After several hours of zoo tourism, we retreated for an afternoon snack at the &lt;a href="http://bullandbush.com/"&gt;Bull &amp;amp; Bush Pub and Brewery&lt;/a&gt;.  This, I believe, marked my first vacation experience of this trip.  This is an awesome little English inspired pub that makes their own English style ales and serves them for inexpensive prices.  The kids didn't really go for it, but I really, REALLY enjoyed it.  I probably would have stayed there all day if not coaxed out of there by my family.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After a few beers and some appetizers, Jenny, Maylee, and Quin dropped Ethan and I off at the movie theater where we saw "How to Train your Dragon," while they went shopping somewhere.  When done, we went back to Maylee's apartment for a little dinner and bed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Tomorrow promises a long day of travel through Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona.  Should be a hoot.  Hopefully I'll have a chance to post again tomorrow night before I crash.  The day following should be fun - we'll get to see my parents for the first time in 4 months and will get to see the Grand Canyon for the first time (for some).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;By the way, pictures for this trip can be seen at the following link:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style=" border-collapse: collapse; color: rgb(102, 102, 102); white-space: pre; font-family:'Lucida Grande';"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:medium;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/grady.mke/SpringBreak2010?feat=directlink"&gt;http://picasaweb.google.com/grady.mke/SpringBreak2010?feat=directlink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/6294685685561237338/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=6294685685561237338' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/6294685685561237338'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/6294685685561237338'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2010/04/vacation-2010-april-3-denver.html' title='Vacation 2010 - April 3, Denver'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-8289393823282005403</id><published>2010-04-02T20:30:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2010-04-02T21:06:51.667-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Vacaton 2010 Leg 1</title><content type='html'>Vacation 2010 Leg 1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I'm trying a couple of new things this time around. I've recently identified that I require an ipad in order to survive. In order to prepare myself I've decided to post my vacation blog entirely from my iPhone. We'll see how long this lasts. I think I may be too old to learn to thumb type and ignore basic punctuation and spelling rules, but I suppose time will tell. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our 2010 "trip" started last night around 4:30 central time. Our destinations this year inlude Denver, the grand canyon, then finally Phoenix where my parents have recently "relocated" for their winters. We opted to drive since the thought of flying with Quin makes even a brave man cringe. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original plan was to leave after Ethans tennis lesson at 5:30, but we found out later that tennis had been canceled, so I had designs on leaving by 3:00. Well, things rarely work out he way you think. Jenny has to run reports once a month at the beginning of the month. On this run, everything that could go wrong with those reports did. When all was sai and done we didn't get out of the house until 4:30. Even then, as we were trying to leave, Ethan fell while rinning to the car and had a boo boo that had to be tended to before we could go. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We managed to make it to Rockford by 6:00 in time to het so e dinner at some ghetto mall in the greater Rockford area. Ethan was treated to some typical suburban teenage language with m-er f-er this and that… I guess they are going to bear that eventually. Ethan heard it from me and my family years ago…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plan was to drive all night and we accomplished that goal. We used a tested method of listening to a book on tape while we drove which really made the time go fast. I also employed a new technique of drinking a 5 hour energy drink which has kept me up through now. Everything seemed to work out well. We made it to Denver with two stops by 9:00 mountain time this morning. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of observations from the road. Iowa is much more interesting than Illinois or Nebraska. They also have very nice rest areas with wifi and everything. At their least frequent they are spaced at 40 miles and most of the time they are at 20.  Nebraska is just damn big and seems even moreso when you don't even get into the state until 11:30.  Lastly, as tempting as it might seem at the time, Sterling, Colorado is not a great place to stop for gas or food even though it is the first town of any size in Colorado. Gas is expensive, the water has nitrates, an the fii doesn't taste all that good. Other than that it's nice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today has been a bit if a blur. We went to Dave and busters, I tried to take a nap and failed. All in all it was a pretty good first day of vacation. It finally turned into a vacation at 5:00 tonight when I cracked my first Colorado beer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tomrrow should be nice regardless of what we do since Jenny and I will be able to amass more than two hours of sleep between us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an aside, this posting method is kind of painful. I can't get as much on the page as I want to because this is so slow…. I'll keep trying. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Post From My iPhone&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p class='blogpress_location'&gt;Location:&lt;a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Fairmount%20Dr,Denver,United%20States%4039.707230%2C-104.891013&amp;z=10'&gt;Fairmount Dr,Denver,United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/8289393823282005403/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=8289393823282005403' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/8289393823282005403'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/8289393823282005403'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2010/04/vacaton.html' title='Vacaton 2010 Leg 1'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-6674783148427839433</id><published>2010-03-13T15:18:00.005-06:00</published><updated>2010-03-16T22:07:51.174-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Ethan'/><title type='text'>March Musings</title><content type='html'>&lt;div&gt;On this eve of "the closest thing the Irish have to Christmas," I'm sitting on my couch musing about my hopelessly silly kids.  Nature dictates that the oldest is silly like his dad, but nurture appears to have a strong influence on the youngest.  Too bad - we thought he had a chance!!!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We were out and about gathering materials for our latest home improvement project, built-in cabinets and a desk in our office (the wood floor was finished up two weeks ago).  After we finished getting some things at WalMart we came across some girl scouts selling cookies.  I have a soft spot for kids selling things, especially sweets, so I bought a box of Thanks-A-Lots (I think that makes 10 boxes this year).  Quin has a highly developed sweet tooth and immediately started saying one of his favorite words, "Cookie."  We we opened up the box and all had one.  Not more than a minute later, Quin was again repeating "Cookie, cookie, cookie!"  Jenny thought he was palming it, or had just put it in his lap since very little time had passed and said to him, "no, you just had one.  Where is your cookie?"  Without missing a beat he leaned forward and opened his mouth and pointed to it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;His vocabulary is progressing well beyond cookie, though many of his sentences are just negative versions of things we want him to do.  "No nigh-nigh" is one I hear each night before bed.  He has started to branch out, though.  He is very polite and frequently says things like "Thank you daddy."  One I particularly liked recently was when I was trying to give him some juice.  He took one drink and said "Ucki duece."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Not to be outdone, the older one continues to be goofy in many ways.  If you've met Ethan, you know he is quite the talker.  We're taking a trip to Arizona next month and I'm pretty sure he will likely talk at least 20 hours of the 30 it takes to get out there...  One of our recent conversations was that he hoped he would never be homeless because he didn't want to have to bath in the lake.  He said he had heard about these fish that would swim into your penis and eat your testicles.  8 year old boys are apparently fascinated with testicles...  At one point he referred to the fish as "nasty little nut eaters!"&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Just today we were watching Chowder on Cartoon Network.  Not a particularly good show, nor would I recommend it for your children that aren't so demented, but Ethan seems to like it.  In this episode, for some reason, Chowder had to prove that he was not a baby or something (I was barely paying attention), so he took off a towel he was wearing.  Ethan started giggling and said, "he's showing him the goods.  You know... his privates."  During the same episode, some fairy things were about to kiss when Ethan announced, "Look dad, they're going to have sex."  Well, I'm not proud to say that I was intrigued immediately, but quickly realized that Ethan thought that kissing was "having sex."  I can't imagine what he talks about in school...  For those that are worried, I did explain to him that it was not, indeed, having sex, it was just kissing.  I assured him that I would tell him all about "having sex" when he was a little older and that he would think it is really gross right now...  He agreed.  Whew - that talk was averted for a little while longer...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's it for now.

It sounded like things were going pretty well, for the most part, until I was in the Hartfield Jackson Airport in Atlanta awaiting my boarding call to return home to Milwaukee.  That was when I received a call from Ethan.  "Dad," he said, "what do you do when Quin poops in the bathtub?"  You see, I am the poop cleaner in our house.  If it manages to get into a diaper or into the toilet, Jenny has no issue dealing with it.  If, on the other hand, it ends up somewhere outside the "norm," that's when dad the poopman steps in.  Unfortunately, the poopman was 700 miles away and wouldn't be back in time to take care of this situation.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When I arrived home, I asked Jenny how she managed the log.  She said she just forced it down the drain.  Unfortunately it was so big, she had to use a toothbrush to help force it down!  When Ehtan heard this he asked in horror, "Whose toothbrush did you use, mine???"

I'm happy to say that he is finally speaking in sentences!  Of course, most, if not all of his sentences are just telling us no to different things that we want him to do.  "No ni-ni."  "No eat."  "No Bath!"  I guess you have to start somewhere!&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The other day, Ethan, Quin, and I were out to eat and had some time to burn before we went to swimming lessons, so we went to Best Buy.  We walked in past the DVDs.  I was looking at the Weeds Season 5 DVD with Marie Louise Parker on the front - Quin pointed at the cover and said, "Mommy!"  I thought that was pretty nice, because even though she's older than Jenny, she's quite good looking.  We then progressed further down the aisle when Quin picked out another movie where he pointed at Brad Pitt and said, "Daddy."  Smart boy!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We went to the pet expo down at State Fair Park yesterday.  We aren't really in the market right now for a dog, but we thought we'd start looking...  Ethan has fallen in love with the Boston Terrier breed.  Who knows what will happen ultimately, but it was fun to have the kids interacting with dogs again...&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/8785007011770660408/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=8785007011770660408' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/8785007011770660408'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/8785007011770660408'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2010/02/no-ni-ni.html' title='No ni-ni...'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-524691142069691088</id><published>2010-01-03T20:20:00.004-06:00</published><updated>2010-01-03T20:49:25.607-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Ethan'/><title type='text'>New Year</title><content type='html'>Happy New Year!  In the name of New Year's Resolutions, I've resolved to blog on a more regular basis this year!  I've found that blogging is nice on several levels.  It allows people who care to follow along with what is going on with our lives (or ignore it, which is nice as well).  This is important right now since my parents have moved to Arizona for the remainder of this winter and will be grandchild starved for 3 months!  But more than that, it allows us to go back years later and see what we were doing now.&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've been putting off an update for a long time now.  At first it was innocent enough - just didn't have time.  Soon it started to feed itself, though.  I kept thinking of how much had happened since my last update, and thinking that I'd never get it all into a post.  The more I thought about it, the more I dreaded doing another update for fear of leaving something out.  I've finally decided to take a stand and to post what I think of at the time, knowing that my family will remind me of the things I've forgotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quinton has been growing up quite a bit in the last few months.  Physically he has grown into a full blown toddler.  I don't recall if he was in a toddler bed as of the last posting, but he is.  It all happened because he kept climbing out of his crib and falling down, waking him up.  The transition to the toddler bed has been a difficult one, but we have it under relative control at this time.  For the first few weeks it seemed much worse than when he was an infant getting up three times a night.  I think we got used to getting pretty regular, long periods of sleep, and being torn from that made me quite cranky!  Anyway, with the help of The Supernanny, we are now back to where we were at several weeks before he started crawling out of his crib, which is to say that we can put him down to bed awake and he will fall asleep, and he will stay in his room most of the night, even if he wakes up - he has started getting up earlier for some reason, but we'll deal with that as time goes by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quin has also started to become more and more vocal.  I would say he's a bit behind where Ethan was at this age, but he is definitely starting to roll!  Each day he learns new words, though many of them are used incorrectly and most of them are hard to pick out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His favorite word is "no," which is not as bad as it might sound.  No is to Quin like Aloha is to the Polynesians - it has several meanings.  The only way to know what he's really saying is to listen to the inflection of the word.  For example, "No," said with force and cross eyes really means no.  "No," said in a sing-song way with a smile generally means "yes."  Confusing?  Yes, but I suppose that's what it is to be a parent...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quin has recently started to show a genuine love of books.  He will pick up a book, hand it to either one of us (or any adult, really), and say "Book!"  He then sits on the floor and patiently waits for you to read to him.  He won't sit through the entire book, though he'll be interested longer if you make funny noises while reading the book!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of Quin's better qualities is his courtesy.  He learned "Thank You" several weeks ago and uses it in the correct context almost all the time.  Today we were at our friend's house ice skating.  Quin was struggling to get going on the ice, so our friend Tim helped him to move in the right direction.  Quin immediately said "dit dyu," which translates to "thank you."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quin's had a couple of sicknesses in the last month, but recently he's been feeling quite well.  So well, in fact, that he appears to have no end to his appetite.  He eats and tries to eat pretty much every waking hour.  Two nights ago, I put Quin down to bed and came downstairs to take a shower.  When I got out of the shower, I found Quin in the kitchen helping himself to some Cheerios.  Jenny said she thought it was me eating, and was confulsed why I hadn't responded when she asked me something...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps one of the most challenging things about Quin right now is to deal with his love of water.  He loves all things water.  He loves to be in the pool, go down waterslides, he puts his face in the water, he loves baths...  He also loves to drink water.  Lots of water.  And he doesn't wait for us to get it for him either.  We have the misfortune of having a refridgerator with ice and water in the door.  It is old enough that it does not have a lock on those devices.  Quin figured out how to run these long ago.  He has recently discovered all the different things he can put under the water dispenser to fill.  If there is a glass available, he will fill it up and start to drink from it.  If there isn't a glass, he'll go into the tupperware cupboard and fill up one of those containers.  He has recently tried to fill some of his cup-like toys with water.  The only problem with that is that some of them have holes in the bottom!  When he is done drinking the water, he starts pouring it from one container to the next, and eventually will dump it on the floor.  He will generally attempt to clean this up, but that usually ends up making more of a mess than the water itself...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course Quin is growing by leaps and bounds, so there's lots of things to write about him right now.  Ethan is moving right along as well, though there's not that much interesting to write about him.  One encounter with him was pretty funny, though.  A week or two ago, Ethan was sitting in the car waiting to go somewhere.  I put Quin in the car and said something like, "Whew, something smells bad.  Ethan, did you poop your pants?"  Typical dad humor, and generally Ethan plays along.  This time, however, Ethan pulled a new one on me.  He said, "Dad, why do you always say that to me?  That's &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;insulting&lt;/span&gt;."  I was kind of shocked - I'd never heard that word from him and was surprised to hear it in the right context, so I asked him what he meant by that.  He said, "You are always accusing me of doing things that you know I wouldn't do, but that Quinton would."  I couldn't do anything by apologize and to stop insulting him!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/524691142069691088/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=524691142069691088' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/524691142069691088'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/524691142069691088'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-year.html' title='New Year'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-3141335851629927119</id><published>2009-11-27T23:38:00.006-06:00</published><updated>2010-01-07T19:39:59.290-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Ethan'/><title type='text'>Kickles and Hillbillies</title><content type='html'>Of course my wife reminded me of some things I forgot...  If only she knew how to blog!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other day Ethan and I were driving to Soccer when we passed a section of road we frequently pass.  On one side of the road is a pretty steep, tree-covered hill with a couple of houses on top.  Ethan asked me, matter of factly, if the people living there were hillbillies.  To be honest, I was laughing to myself, but calmly collected myself before explaining that they were not hillbillies.  I was a little surprised that I was unable to come up with a really good description of a hillbilly without referencing Deliverance...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I mentioned this one or not yet, but it deserves a repeat if I have not.  A few months back, Jenny's nephew invited us to his apartment to dinner with his two kids.  His oldest is about a year older than Ethan.  The two of them get along very well.  While they were eating, Matthew asked Ethan if he wanted to play cards after dinner.  Intrigued, one of the adults (there were many, so I can't remember who it was) asked him what type of card games he liked to play.  He answered, "you know, five card stud, Texas Hold 'em, those kind of games.  My grandma taught me how to play them.  Ethan looked at him and said, very matter of factly, "My grandma taught me how to crochet."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also forgot a couple of cute things Quin has done in the past months.  He doesn't do it so much anymore, but about a month ago, we were reading a book to him called Fishy Kisses and Gorilla Hugs.  Jenny taught him to do both, so he was going around giving everybody fishy kisses with his mouth pursed and moving...  He still gives them on occasion, but not quite as much as he did a month ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He also loves to be tickled.  He pronounces it "kickle."  He'll raise his shirt and stand by you saying, "kickle" until you tickle his belly.  One day he was playing with a toy dinosaur, complete with growling dinosaur roars.  At one point, he took the dinosaur and put him on my stomach and said, in a growly dinosaur voice, "kickle, kickle."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, Quin has been using the potty lately as well!  Well, I guess he's not really using it.  He stands by the toilet and asks me to put him on there, pants on and all.  He'll sit there for a minute or two, smiling, then grab the roll of toilet paper, take a few pieces (I help him to only take a few pieces), then pretend to wipe his butt.  When he gets done wiping his butt, he takes the same piece out from behind him and wipes his face...  Not sure where he saw that one.  I can only assume Jenny does that.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/3141335851629927119/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=3141335851629927119' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/3141335851629927119'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/3141335851629927119'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2009/11/kickles-and-hillbillies.html' title='Kickles and Hillbillies'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-4762330979540241594</id><published>2009-10-19T21:51:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2009-10-19T21:53:52.213-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><title type='text'>Freedom...</title><content type='html'>Quin climbed out of his crib the other day.

Of course, it's been a month since we went, so the memories have already started to fade, but I've uploaded some pictures to our photo gallery and the site's slideshow is now showing them.  Hopefully this gives a better idea of how the vacation went.  To see all of the pictures in the album, either click on the slideshow, or try &lt;a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/grady.mke/EagleRiver2009#"&gt;this link here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In August of this year, our family joined the Zieglers, Johnsons, and Abholds on a trip to St. Germaine, WI to stay at one of the remote Black Bear Lodge resorts.  The resort was pretty nice, 6 cabins arranged along the lake with piers out front, a firepit, a shared fish house, and a "game room."  We selected the first off-peak week to book our stay, and were rewarded with some of the coldest weather I can remember on a summer vacation.  The first day was pretty nice, in the low 80s, and the second wasn't too bad, in the mid to upper 70s, but that was the end of that.  Weather ranged from the 30s at night to windy and 50s during the day.  Our cabins faced west, so we took the full brunt of the wind most of the time.  Luckily we were able to find activities to do that did not involve going in the water or being outside all the time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One such activity was going to GI Joe.  Early in the week, Ethan and I decided that we were going to see this movie during this week because we rarely get an opportunity at home to get out to the movies.  Unfortunately we didn't end up going until the second to the last night, and that was one of the nights that was actually pretty nice from a weather perspective.  Nonetheless, we both enjoyed the movie, Ethan moreso than me as he has, or more specifically &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;had&lt;/span&gt; declared it his favorite movie of all time.  On the ride back from the movie, Ethan was discussing the finer aspects of movie making and asking my opinion on whether they would make another one.  He has pretty much figured out Hollywood already as he basically equates the likelihood of a sequel on the money the original takes in.  Hopefully I don't spoil the ending, but Cobra gets captured by GI Joe (there, I spoiled it).  Ethan summed up the potential of future Joe movies by saying this,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Everybody knows the bad guys are going to get out, and they're probably going to make a lot of money, so I'm sure they'll make another one..."&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quin busied himself all week by perfecting several new skills.  One of the ones he's been working on for awhile now is the ability to walk up and down stairs without having to sit down.  I'm not sure why he is so intent on doing that, but once he sets his mind on something, he does it and doesn't stop until he's satisfied that it is done right.  So he entertained himself by walking up and down the camp stairs for what seemed like hours on end.  By the end of the week, he could do it without falling or sitting down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems silly to talk about now since he has added so many new words, but the vacation up north seemed to be Quin's verbal coming out party.  Probably because I don't see him all day, but it seemed to me that Quin learned and used more words on vacation than he's ever used before.  Now, looking back, I think that may have been true, but his latest achievements have far eclipsed those of that week.  Let's see, he was still using "all done" with great success, he had "go-go-go" down pat, and was also starting to attempt to pronounce some more difficult things.  For example, one day he got stuck in a lawn chair.  He looked at Jenny and said, "guck."  On another day, he picked up a rock and proudly said "cock."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, many of our activities involved things away from camp, and away from the wind.  On a particularly cold day, we found our way to the go-kart track.  Ethan was &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;very&lt;/span&gt; excited to drive his own go-kart.  Unfortunately, when we got there we realized that you had to be 53" tall to drive one yourself - he only measuredin at 52" (thank God!).  So Ethan abided and rode tandem with me - I let him drive, and let me tell you, &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;it's a good thing he didn't drive himself!!!&lt;/span&gt;  After the go-karts, he discussed at length the possibility that he might grow an inch in the next 24 hours so he could drive a go-kart tomorrow!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, it was a very nice week, despite the weather.  We got to see some of the tamest ducks I've ever seen, we saw a dog destroy a muskrat Discovery Channel style, and Ethan and I even fished a little bit.  In fact, once I found Ethan fishing off the end of the dock by himself with no prodding or bargaining from me at all!!!  Now that the kid's trip is out of the way for the year, it's time for Jenny and I to start planning the adult's-only vacation that we so desperately need!!!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/218814044082653222/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=218814044082653222' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/218814044082653222'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/218814044082653222'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2009/08/vacation-2009-evil-river-part-ii.html' title='Vacation 2009 - Evil River Part II'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-8867171992832795454</id><published>2009-08-26T13:31:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2009-08-26T13:33:34.548-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><title type='text'>Quin Quickie</title><content type='html'>I couldn't resist blogging this before my "big vacation update" later this week...&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Quin has been talking A LOT MORE lately.  I sat down to try to figure out the words he knew now and lost track.  He's become much more interesting in the last month or so.  Anyway, a game that I always play with him is to push his nose and say "beep beep."  Ethan might do it to him, too.  So now he goes around and pushes people's noses and says "bee bee" just like we do...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Apparently he doesn't just stop at noses, though.  This morning when I was changing his pants, he grabbed his penis and said "bee bee..."

This is a picture of Quinton kissing his cousin.  Man, he's really going for it!  OK, they are second cousins once removed, or third cousins or something (you'd have to ask Blaine for the exact designation), so that's probably OK in most You can tell they are from awhile ago as they were for Jodi's baby shower - and they've already had the baby!!!  Man, I just don't 'blog enough...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Swimming at the Lake&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jenny and I participated in a triathlon two weekends ago.  My parents came down to watch the boys while we were out punishing our bodies (thanks mom and dad).  The festivities took place in a state park, so we purchased a state park sticker.  Since we purchased the sticker, we've decided we should try to get our money's worth from it - so to make a long introduction a bit longer, we've been going to the state parks in the area all week this week.  On Tuesday, Jenny has her tennis league, so it's just me and the boys for the evening.  Last night was warmer and sunny, so we decided to go to the state park and hit the beach.  Quin just loved the water.  I couldn't keep him out of it.  He first found some puddles towards the top of the beach where he played for quite awhile.  Until, that is, he realized there was a BIG puddle not too far away (the lake).  Once he got there I couldn't get him out of there!  He just loves the water.  He makes me kind of nervous, though, since he has absolutely no fear of, and also no coordination in the water.  Eventually he found a way to get around without falling in the water and swallowing a stomach full...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The funniest part of this story is the contrast between the boys taking a trip to the lake alone and taking a trip with mom in tow.  When we went to the lake last night, we all put our swimming suits on at home, went to the lake, swam, then remembered that we needed a towel - luckily there was one in the van.  We all used the same towel, dried off, went home, and went to bed.  Tonight we did the same trip, this time with mom.  When Ethan and I got home from work and camp, there was a picnic supper packed, extra clothes, four towels, garbage bags for our refuse, I could go on.  Let's just say there are differences between trips that dad plans and those that mom does...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/Snoy-JGaUEI/AAAAAAAAAlY/RcSzNJ1O0xc/s1600-h/IMG_2015.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/Snoy-JGaUEI/AAAAAAAAAlY/RcSzNJ1O0xc/s320/IMG_2015.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5366657949141454914" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Twinkle Twinkle Little Star&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quinton has been serenading us with his lovely singing voice lately.  We've been shocked lately to hear a very recognizable rendition of "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star," or it could be the alphabet song...  The words aren't that clear, but the tune is spot on.  He is already a better singer than Jenny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Remote Control Car&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A week or two ago, I got Ethan's remote control out and we played with it in the driveway.  Ethan and I were having a blast, but Quinton didn't like it so much...  He spent the entire 30 minutes we played with it on my lap clinging for dear life.  Strange what kids will be afraid of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Marley and Me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A week ago, Ethan and I watched the movie "Marley and Me" while Jenny was gone for a night out with the girls.  It is a basic movie about life, family, and the family pet, Marley.  If you just looked at the title and watched casually, you would think that the movie is actually about a dog and its owner.  If you are an attentive and perceptive viewer, however, like Ethan, you might just take away a different message from the movie.  The message Ethan took away from it was quite intuitive.  Towards the end of the movie, Ethan says to me, "Dad, do you want grandchildren?"  I said, "of course."  He replied, "Well, you better hope Quin has some then, because I'm never going to."  When I asked him why, he told me, "because kids ruin your life."  Apparently the message he took away from the movie was that being young and married with a dog is a blast and you get to "make out" all the time.  Once you have kids, though, your life is over and you don't even get to "make out" anymore...  Very perceptive, indeed.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/9181362191229160196/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=9181362191229160196' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/9181362191229160196'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/9181362191229160196'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2009/08/kissing-cousins.html' title='Kissing Cousins'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/Snoy-qksCYI/AAAAAAAAAlg/E2_67qhpaRs/s72-c/IMG_2016.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-7096983617721078087</id><published>2009-07-12T21:17:00.006-05:00</published><updated>2009-07-12T21:35:00.171-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Ethan'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Cubscouts'/><title type='text'>Cub Scout Camp</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/Slqcv5kSjBI/AAAAAAAAAkg/Fv2sqELj6x0/s1600-h/DSC_0157.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 213px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/Slqcv5kSjBI/AAAAAAAAAkg/Fv2sqELj6x0/s320/DSC_0157.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5357767053431442450" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Cub Scout Camp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week, Ethan and I attended Cub Scout day camp for our second year.  This year we went on the 3 day camp.  Camp started at 9:00 AM and went until 4:00 PM.  Besides the mosquitoes, it was a bona-fide blast for both of us.  Ethan was able to do all sorts of different activities, including archery (which is is very good at), mini-golf (which he is not so good at), highlander games, knight's quest, etc.  For me, it was a good opportunity for me to see Ethan interact with other kids and adults and how he did in the different physical and social situations.  Let me tell you, if you ever find yourself annoyed at your child, spend some time with other people's children - like 18 of them.  You will quickly appreciate your own!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethan proved very adept at archery, and we got do shoot each day we were there.  He also very much enjoyed the castle out of which his group was based.  I was very proud of the fact that he tested into the "swimmers" category, the highest category at camp.  To do this, he had to swim 6 laps in the lake swim area on his front, then 2 on his back.  Only 2 other kids in his group tested that high!  Guess those YMCA lessons are paying off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SlqdAvxY5mI/AAAAAAAAAkw/u7Q3TYrMUTQ/s1600-h/DSC_0169.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 213px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SlqdAvxY5mI/AAAAAAAAAkw/u7Q3TYrMUTQ/s320/DSC_0169.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5357767342859806306" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The camp is themed for the different years in scouts.  Wolf scouts are the Pirates and do their activities around a pirate ship.  Their leader is Captain Chris.  Bear scouts, which is Ethan's group, are the Knights and are based out of the castle.  Their leader was Sir Jim.  Webelos are miners (as well as minors) and are based out of the mine.  Their leader was Miner Mikey.  The staff was outstanding and kept the kids engaged at all times.  At one point Ethan assured me that he was going to stay in scouts until he received his Eagle.  I would love if he would stick with it that long...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At closing of the second day, the heads of each of the groups declared that for the last day, the kids could shed their costumes and wear regular clothes just like the leaders.  The leaders, incidentally, wore clothing matching their role - so Captain Chris wore a pirate outfit, etc.  When they said that, Ethan was just about vibrating with excitement.  Dressing up in costumes is one of his favorite things in the world.  We spent about two hours the rest of the night preparing our costumes, him as a knight and me as a miner.  The next morning he could not wait to get to camp!  By 7:30 he was already asking me if it was time to go yet.  When we finally got to camp at 8:45, he was disappointed to find out that not all kids shared his enthusiasm.  In fact, only about 3 of the 80 kids at camp dressed up at all, and I was the only adult...  He made me very proud, though, and stuck with his custume throughout the day.  His biggest worry coming into the day was that his costume would not be the coolest.  At the end of the day, however, he was convinced that his was, indeed, the coolest costume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Miscellaneous Updates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quinton has discovered that he likes to drive the vehicles that Grandpa and Grandma Grady bought for Ethan some years back.  What is surprising is that he is actually able to drive them to some extent!  Invariably he ends up in the weeds and somebody has to turn him around, but he definitely knows how to make them go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is starting to say more and more words.  He says "bye bye" regularly now and waves.  He is very goofy sometimes...  When I first see him after work, he gets a big smile on his face and runs up to me, seemingly to give me a hug.  When he is almost to me, he stops, bends over, pretends to pick something up off the ground, then hands it to me...  Not quite sure what he's doing there.  He has also been prone lately to spin around in circles for several seconds until he falls down from dizziness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm sure there's more, but I can't think of it right now.  Hopefully Jenny will read this and remind me of what I've missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SlqdI1cKnLI/AAAAAAAAAk4/cYZyceOzwPo/s1600-h/DSC_0021.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 213px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SlqdI1cKnLI/AAAAAAAAAk4/cYZyceOzwPo/s320/DSC_0021.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5357767481820355762" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/7096983617721078087/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=7096983617721078087' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/7096983617721078087'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/7096983617721078087'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2009/07/cub-scout-camp.html' title='Cub Scout Camp'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/Slqcv5kSjBI/AAAAAAAAAkg/Fv2sqELj6x0/s72-c/DSC_0157.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-7165952470108124596</id><published>2009-06-18T09:24:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2009-06-18T09:24:48.648-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>It's amazing how Quin already thinks he can do everything his big brother can do.

It doesn't allow me to post pictures or anything, but should allow me to post more quickly and, therefore, more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quin woke up ata 5:00 this morning!  What is the matter with him!!??!  About a week ago he went four days straight waking up at 6:30 or later.  Jenny had to wake him up one day at 7:30 so she could get Ethan off to school!  I don't remember when they start sleeping properly.  I know it's by the age of 6 or 7 if their name is Ethan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quin's talking quite a bit more. &amp;amp;nbsp;It helps that he can somewhat tell us what he wants.  If he's hungry, he goes and points to his high chair, but normally he just wants a "nana (banana)." Of course, his most effective way of saying that he wants something that we're not providing properly is to scream at a very high pitch.  Remember the most annoying sound in the world from Dumb and Dumber?

Two weeks ago she suffered what appears to be a slipped disc in her back.  Her back legs quickly became disabled, and over the course of the next two weeks she lost control of her bladder and bowels.  She was almost nine years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kids really loved her.  Quin probably moreso than Ethan, though she's been a fixture in our house since Ethan has been around.  Quinton just loved her, despite the fact that he tried to kick her on occasion and pulled her hair, all of which she handled without complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monday was a very difficult day for Jenny and I.  She spent the weekend at the vet in hopes of a miracle that just didn't come.  On Monday, the whole family went to the vet knowing what was going to happen.  Jenny and I spent a lot of the time in tears.  Ethan looked sad and seemed like he wanted to cry but just couldn't.  I think he was upset most by seeing how upset Jenny and I were.  Later in the day he did manage to get a good cry out, but it was a confusing time for him I believe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SictHX-1erI/AAAAAAAAAgo/MAP-iuGQlW4/s1600-h/IMG_5253.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SictHX-1erI/AAAAAAAAAgo/MAP-iuGQlW4/s320/IMG_5253.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5343289087618284210" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Her life ended peacefully, though a tad early.

Ethan and Quin's only remaining great-grandmother passed away, Ethan received his first communion, and Quin has had his first ride on the lawnmower...  Let's begin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To set the table, I used to watch video blogs on the mac while I was feeding Quin last year.  It was nice because I was able to control them with the remote control while I used my other hand to hold the bottle.  One of my favorite blogs is College Humor.  The video I happened to be watching that day was titled "Pot Cookie Monster" about a cookie monster like the one from Sesame Street but instead of regular cookies, he liked pot cookies...  Here is the video...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object height="340" width="560"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/b4ZMyK9Ko74&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;rel=0"&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"&gt;&lt;param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"&gt;&lt;embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/b4ZMyK9Ko74&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;fs=1&amp;amp;rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" height="340" width="560"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At any rate, about a week ago, out of the blue, Ethan asked me who my favorite Sesame Street character was.  It's not unusual for him to ask my favorite of whatever, today it just happened to be Sesame Street Characters...  I answered, because I have to, "I don't know, maybe Oscar the Grouch."  He responded that his was Big Bird.  I then thought about it and said, "wait, maybe Cookie Monster."  He asked me, "don't you mean Pot Cookie Monster."  I guess the moral of the story is that Net Nanny and other programs to protect your kids from these types of things on the internet aren't that effective if you are letting them watch you browse the internet...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last weekend was Ethan's first communion.  He did fine, but he was a little nervous.  At one point I caught him rehearsing the exact position of his hands when he went up to receive the host.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quin is getting bigger and more bold all the time.  He has now successfully climbed the ladder up to Ethan's top bunk and found a way to crawl into the bed!  Today I found him on top of the kitchen table!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quin is also talking a bit more.  His best expression (the one we can understand the best) is "All Done," which he sings rather than says.  Lately he's been making Mmmm sounds, which Jenny hopes will lead him to finally say "mama" but so far no luck.  He's also starting to mimic Ethan pretty well.  Ethan is a bit of a protector and enforcer with Quin, so when Quin starts doing something "naughty," Ethan says "No no no."  Of course, Quin picked that up right away and can now say "No No No" in the right context and everything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SgOXLsRQDiI/AAAAAAAAAgY/CDgTaP44gfY/s1600-h/DSC_0232.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 213px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SgOXLsRQDiI/AAAAAAAAAgY/CDgTaP44gfY/s320/DSC_0232.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5333272610854669858" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SgOXLb9VJzI/AAAAAAAAAgQ/YidKCjOkOR4/s1600-h/DSC_0151.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 213px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SgOXLb9VJzI/AAAAAAAAAgQ/YidKCjOkOR4/s320/DSC_0151.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5333272606476150578" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/777903033874844174/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=777903033874844174' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/777903033874844174'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/777903033874844174'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2009/05/sesame-street.html' title='Sesame Street'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SgOXAKs1UcI/AAAAAAAAAgI/tThmBRMUb_I/s72-c/DSC_0128.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-2277235324581724570</id><published>2009-03-29T21:26:00.003-05:00</published><updated>2009-03-29T21:36:30.342-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Ethan'/><title type='text'>3 S's for Ethan</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SdAt1i7JdUI/AAAAAAAAAgA/wxQAVIPsFLQ/s1600-h/IMG_5569.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SdAt1i7JdUI/AAAAAAAAAgA/wxQAVIPsFLQ/s320/IMG_5569.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5318801557855761730" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;It's been awhile since I've updated this site on my favorite 7-year old.  Ethan's been doing quite a bit lately, now in the home stretch of his 2nd grade year, about to receive his first communion.  But why the title "3 S's for Ethan?"  Really it all stems from a sad little game I play with my brain when I'm trying to remember something.  I figure my brain can only remember 3 things at a time, and then only if I name them interestingly.  In this case, I came up with three things I wanted to write about for Ethan, and I managed to make them all conform to some word starting with S.  Let's begin:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Skiing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of weeks ago, Ethan, Jenny, and I went to Lutsen, MN for a small ski vacation.  We left Quin with his Grandpa and Grandma Grady for the few days we were up there.  It was a great vacation, but the nicest part was to see how well Ethan had taken to skiing.  This is his fourth year on the slopes, but it's only been a couple of times each year.  Nevertheless, he has proven to be a very adept student of the sport, and is now skiing much faster than I'm comfortable seeing.  By the end of the vacation, and one day of ski school, he was handling all the hills that Jenny was comfortable with.  My only concern is that he is a bit cocky.  By the end of the second day skiing, he was begging me to let him go down the black diamond hills, the ones rated for "experts only."  I talked him out of it, but I'm sure it won't last too many more years.  Where has my baby gone!!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SdAt1Gg5A4I/AAAAAAAAAf4/o5Sp_64t_WQ/s1600-h/IMG_5567.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SdAt1Gg5A4I/AAAAAAAAAf4/o5Sp_64t_WQ/s320/IMG_5567.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5318801550229439362" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Segway&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my posts about Disney last year, I mentioned that I got to ride a Segway, and it was awesome.  On that trip, Ethan and I tried to convince Jenny that we should buy a Segway for us to use at home.  She said we could do that when she got new furniture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of weeks ago, Jenny ordered a new couch and coffee table from Overstock.com.  It was delivered a week later, and while I was putting it together, Ethan came in the room and said, "awesome!  Now we can get a Segway."  It had been almost a full year since we had talked about it, yet he remembered the conversation immediately upon seeing new furniture in the living room!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Adult Things (wait for the S connection)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;On Thursday night, Ethan and I were saying our prayers.  I mentioned that we should pray for Grandma and Grandpa so they had a safe trip back from Arizona.  Ethan asked me where that was, so I explained that it was in the southern part of the US between New Mexico and Nevada.  In fact, I explained, it wasn't far from where Jenny and I were going to take a vacation in the coming months.  "Are you taking us?"  Ethan asked me, referring to himself and his brother.  I told him no, that we weren't taking them.  He asked me why that was, to which I answered, "because we're going to do adult things."  "Like swear?"  he retorted...&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/2277235324581724570/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=2277235324581724570' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/2277235324581724570'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/2277235324581724570'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2009/03/3-ss-for-ethan.html' title='3 S&apos;s for Ethan'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SdAt1i7JdUI/AAAAAAAAAgA/wxQAVIPsFLQ/s72-c/IMG_5569.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-8622737854971117814</id><published>2009-03-18T18:07:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2009-03-18T19:58:22.508-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><title type='text'>Smartest Kid Alive???</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/ScGYpg8RrZI/AAAAAAAAAfY/aYgBw4hBIt8/s1600-h/IMG_5515.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/ScGYpg8RrZI/AAAAAAAAAfY/aYgBw4hBIt8/s320/IMG_5515.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5314696874258705810" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't be sure, and I'm probably not a good judge since he is my child, but I'm pretty certain that Quinton is the smartest 13 month old to have graced the planet.  My first clue happened a couple of days ago.  We sat him in his high-chair to feed him and mixed all of the food onto his tray.  His tray does have segmented areas, but we generally just put stuff in the large middle one.  I think we put some chicken, apples, cheese, and crackers on the tray.  He finished up the apples and cheese pretty quickly as they are two of his favorite foods, but the crackers and chicken remained in the center.  I turned around to do something (I would claim that I was doing dishes, but my wife may call my lie out on that one), and when I turned back, all but a few of the crackers had been placed in one of the segmented partitions.  I watched in amazement as he sorted the remaining 2 or 3 crackers out from the chicken and the proceeded to eat the crackers one by one, all the while ignoring the chicken (he doesn't like meat very much).  Some could argue that it is an early sign of OCD, but I'm pretty sure it's an early sign of pure genius!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another sign showed up a couple of weeks ago.  He has a toy telephone that he carries around with him.  Lately I've seen him talking on the telephone.  I'm not really sure how he got that one.  I'm guessing one of us did that to the phone since this is a pretty antiquated toy telephone, looking more like the phones of the 80's and 90's rather than the ones we use today, but he knew what it was for!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of talking, apparently Quin has been talking to us for quite awhile.  It took his grandparents to realize it.  We left Quin with them while we vacationed in Lutsen, MN for a ski getaway and when we returned, my mom and dad told us all the words that they recognized.  Sure enough, taken contextually, he was saying all sorts of words!  Before we left, we thought all he said was "da-da" and "da-di-di-da" and other variations therein.  But if you listen close, he is actually saying words.  The ones we recognize so far (and this is not all inclusive) are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hi&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dada&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Thank You&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;All Done&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Uh Oh&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Barley&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ethan&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Peep&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;I'm sure there are more, but those are some of the more frequent ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven't even started talking about how well he sings!

Quin went and turned one and we barely even acknowledged it!  Well, digitally anyway.  In true Grady boy fashion, Quin celebrated his birthday not once, not twice, but three separate times so that he could cover all his bases.  Our favorite celebration was the one we had at our house with just our little family, though.  It was the first time Quin really got to dig into some chocolate cake, and boy do I think he was impressed!!!  Here you see him starting his sugar coma!  It didn't take him long and he was pretty much demanding that he be fed cake any time one of us was eating some.  I had a piece on my plate the other day when he was eating his supper and he spit out the noodles he had in his mouth and screamed until I gave him a bit of my cake!  He may have a sweet tooth...  Now to figure out how to take advantage of it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quin is developing at a nice pace.  While his height and weight are only in the 40th percentile for his age bracket, his head is solidly in the 90th, which means he really does take after his dad and brother.  He's been walking for about 6 weeks now and is getting quite proficient.  Lately he has even mastered the ability to stand up in the middle of the floor.  The early connection between actually moving forward and hysterical laughter is now gone and he is capable of propelling himself as silently as you could expect a 1 year old to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's still a very happy boy.  He laughs all the time, loves to blow and give big wet kisses.  He still loves Barley!  Barley is such a good girl with him, and that is saying a lot as Quin really likes to give Barley big wet kisses as well!  He likes it so much that he tries to hold her still with clenched fists while he delivers said kisses on her back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had a bit of a traumatic event recently - Quin finally got a haircut.  We were going in to get his 1 year old pictures taken and decided it was finally time to part with the hair (no pun intended).  He was a very good boy in the barber's chair - he didn't cry once.  He only fidgeted a little as the hair was falling down over his face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethan is, of course, doing well as always.  We recently found out the peril of having another reader in the house.  For valentines day, I got Jenny one of those oh so clever cards that said something like, "This card has a wheel you can spin that, whatever shows up, I will promptly provide for you."  On the wheel it was filled with the same task, "A night of hot sex."  Yes, yes, very clever.  Jenny left the card on our nightstand, I assume so she could trade it in at some point, when Ethan got ahold of it.  I was walking through the downstairs when I hear Ethan say, "Jenny."  I didn't realize at the time that he was reading the card!  He got to the point where he was reading the different options on the wheel and repeated several times, "A night of hot sex, a night of hot sex, a night..."  Luckily it hasn't come back in question yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brett thinks that Ethan is destined to be a real ladies' man.  Last weekend when Brett, Blaine, and my parents were down to visit, Brett was having a conversation with Ethan about various things.  Ethan declared to Brett that he, "[knew] a lot about two things, Star Wars, and Jesus."  Rumor has it that Brett has him lined up to teach him so he can score a girlfriend!&lt;img

Year!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you all had a wonderful 2008 and are ready to endure what is sure to be an interesting and trying 2009.  I have mailed a "2008 Year in Review" to some of you, those that I knew could take it (it's a 30 minute video of our family).  If you would like one of your own and did not receive one, please e-mail me and I will be happy to send one out to you.  Now, on to the updates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Quin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So it's been a very long time since I have posted, so obviously Quin is doing all kinds of things he didn't do since the last time.  Where do I start?!?  Well he can climb stairs now.  Ethan says he is too little to go up wooden stairs, and I tend to agree, but that doesn't stop him from trying.  He can "talk," and he still does that quite a bit.  The only things that are recognizable are "dada" and "hi," sometimes he even puts the two together.  I'm pretty sure it is random, though, as he says it not only when he sees me, but when he sees the dog, when he sees a lamp, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quin is now quite proficient in clapping as well as waving bye-bye.  We haven't quite gotten him to blow kisses yet, but he thinks it's funny when we do it, so maybe soon.  He is also not quite walking, though he can stand for longer periods of time than before.  I, personally, thought he would be walking by now, but I'm OK with it taking a little longer than I thought it might.  He is a MONSTER for getting into things, so when he walks it will only be that much worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SWQeYABwXYI/AAAAAAAAAa4/fXB67m2Ia0I/s1600-h/IMG_5322.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SWQeYABwXYI/AAAAAAAAAa4/fXB67m2Ia0I/s320/IMG_5322.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5288385260112862594" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Ethan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethan is doing well as always.  He had a wonderful Christmas and is very excited about all the video games and Legos he got (along with everything else).  His two front teeth have finally started to come in, so that's good.  He has a strong desire to make a movie.  Tonight he asked me how long our camera's battery would last.  He was very disappointed when I told him it would last only 1 hour since he wanted to make a 2 hour movie...  The pose you see here is his idea for a promotional picture for his video of him and his friend dueling with lightsabers.  He wants to put his picture on one side and his friend's on the other and put "v" on his picture and "s" on his friend's, "you know, because that means versus."  Once he has it all put together, he wants me to put it on Youtube.  Maybe I will...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm sure there's more, but I can't think of it right now.  It's a new year, though, so it's time to resolve to do things that may or may not happen - I resolve to update this blog at least twice a month.  There.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy New Year again, and I hope to hear from or see you all very soon.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/6700863638706851733/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=6700863638706851733' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/6700863638706851733'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/6700863638706851733'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2009/01/2009-update.html' title='2009 Update'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SWQeYBXxF0I/AAAAAAAAAbA/-J-zHMMePMo/s72-c/IMG_5327.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-7682816968207473492</id><published>2008-12-06T20:45:00.002-06:00</published><updated>2008-12-06T21:01:13.546-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Ethan'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/STs5H4EQoUI/AAAAAAAAAaY/sP1CML80hTU/s1600-h/IMG_5079.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/STs5H4EQoUI/AAAAAAAAAaY/sP1CML80hTU/s320/IMG_5079.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5276874195866788162" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Quin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quin is literally growing before our eyes.  He has at least 7 teeth now, perhaps 8, and is crawling all over the place.  This time it's not the army crawl I talked about last time but a full-on, four appendage crawl.  And he is getting into EVERYTHING!!!  Did I mention he loves to pull himself up on almost anything?  I know, I know, for those of you that have kids this is really nothing new, but for the second time now I am astounded at what these kids can do!  What's more, after he pulls himself up, he is already experimenting with letting go of the thing providing him support.  We're fairly certain that he will be walking before he's a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We've also proven ourselves as "second child" parents.  The other day Quin had a temperature approaching 104 degrees.  Bad, right?  Of course.  Well, we gave him Advil, gave him a bath, then forced liquids, and got the fever down into the 101 range and didn't even take him to the emergency room once!  A day later, the fever broke, and he had his 9 month well-baby checkup anyway, so he got some medicine for a mild ear infection that seems to be the cause of the sickness.  Jenny and I are very proud of ourselves.  At his checkup, Quin weighed in at 20 pounds and is 29 inches in height.

He has had to repeat several classes, but this most recent one he has had to repeat like 4 times.  This time, he has finally passed onto the new class!!!  His front crawl is getting very strong and he can consistently hold his breath for greater than half the width of the pool.  We're very proud of him!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What's more, I am constantly impressed at what a good kid he is, particularly since I am his father! He has a boy in his class who is very big - OK, he's fat!  Ethan wanted to tell me a story about him the other night and described him as "that boy that wears the blue swimming shirt," and, "the guy that touched the wall last in our swim race."  I asked, "you mean the chunky one?" and he said, "not really.  I guess a little..."  What a good kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's also doing well in school, although he has struggled of late in religion.  Jenny has him so scared of him, though, that she threatened him that if he didn't do better on the next test, she would be angry.  He was so nervous, he went up to the teacher after he took his test and asked her to grade it right there and then.  (He got 100%)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're teetering on the edge of having to finally tell Ethan about Santa.  He is asking questions on almost a nightly basis.  Jenny is starting to feel bad that we are "lying" to him.  I feel covered as I just divert whenever he asks.  For example, the other day Ethan said to me, "Dad, tell me the truth, does Santa come to our house or do you guys come?"  I answered, "I don't understand the question - Hey, doesn't that Monsters vs. Aliens movie look cool!"  OK, maybe not father of the year material, but those of you that read this blog already know that I've been eliminated from the running for some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a parting note, it has snowed down here again.  The snow is showing a similar pattern to last year where we get some snow, it warms up a little to melt some snow, then we get pelted with snow again.  The first day we had snow on the ground, I woke up, looked outside, and said "Oh s**t!"  I then went upstairs to wake up Ethan, he looked outside and said, "Awesome, it snowed!!!"  When I hugged him and got him on the bus, he smiled at me and said, "have a snowy day, dad!"  I guess it is good to remember once in awhile what it's like to be a kid.  Ethan and Quin remind us all the time.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/7682816968207473492/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=7682816968207473492' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/7682816968207473492'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/7682816968207473492'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2008/12/quin-quin-is-literally-growing-before.html' title=''/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/STs5H4EQoUI/AAAAAAAAAaY/sP1CML80hTU/s72-c/IMG_5079.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-6337258089199665317</id><published>2008-11-19T12:08:00.002-06:00</published><updated>2008-11-19T12:20:18.418-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Ethan'/><title type='text'>General Update</title><content type='html'>&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Ethan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;We had Ethan's parent-teacher conference yesterday.  He is doing very well in School, mostly thanks to Jenny.  She works with him constantly on his school work as well as reading, basic math and the like.  It's a lot of work, but it is apparently paying off.  While in the conference we were able to read some of Ethan's stories and reports that he's been writing up.  I plan on posting a couple of them to this blog in the near future.  One of them which is hilarious is his essay on what he would do if he were president.  He is clearly a democrat in the making, let's just put it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of politics, Ethan has been very interested in the whole political process during this election season.  During the lead-up to the election, he was often coming home and asking Jenny and I who we were going to vote for.  Like everything else, he would change his mind on his vote on a daily, or sometimes hourly basis.  I think he ended up "voting" for John McCain.  Yes, we live in the republican underbelly of this proud blue state.  I can't remember his exact reasons for "voting" for McCain.  At one point he wanted Obama because "McCain is too old."  Oddly that's not too far off of the reasoning I was using...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Quinton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quin is rapidly developing right before our eyes.  If you haven't seen him for a month or two, you might not recognize him.  He now has 5 teeth that have broken the gum line with no fewer than 3 more just about to poke through.  The first few teeth he cut were a bit of an ornery experience for him, but now he seems to take it all in stride.  He is a very happy kid almost all the time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is now crawling in earnest.  He's been doing that for almost a month now, but only recently has he gone up on all fours more often than he has done the "army crawl."  One of his favorite destinations is the dog dish, mostly because he knows he's not supposed to go there.  Just yesterday, he headed out of the kitchen, then waited in the hallway until I came out there to look at him.  When he saw me, he turned around and bolted as quickly as he could for the dog dish, laughing all the way.  Now he is starting to venture into the third dimension by pulling himself up onto tables, people's legs, the toilet, you name it.  Looks like it is time to lower his crib mattress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately Quin is sick right now.  We've come to expect this having had Ethan go through the daycare experience.  I seem to remember some winters where Ethan seemed like he was sick from October through June.  Luckily sickness doesn't seem to dampen Quin's spirits at all.  What does dampen his spirits (actually it pisses him off) is when we have to wipe his nose.  Mean parents!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not at home to post pictures and Ethan's creations right now, so look for them in a quick update post later this week.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/6337258089199665317/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=6337258089199665317' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/6337258089199665317'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/6337258089199665317'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2008/11/general-update.html' title='General Update'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-6835031454081386308</id><published>2008-10-27T21:24:00.003-05:00</published><updated>2008-10-27T21:29:57.970-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><title type='text'>Big Strides</title><content type='html'>Quin has learned the fine art of movement.  He still doesn't really "crawl," necessarily, but he lilts along like an army man.  Actually he looks a little like Igor would look if he crawled.  Since he's been in motion, he's bee quite happy and quite a handful.  I don't remember if Ethan got into as much when he was younger, but Quin really likes to get into everything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, Quin's also been sick for the last week or so.  He hasn't really let it get him down, but his stomach has obviously not been feeling well for quite awhile.  That part is easy to remember from when Ethan was younger, unfortunately.  He hangs in there, though.  On the worst day, we had to change his clothes 4 times!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just when I was approaching what I thought was maximum frustration, Quin pulls out another first and totally disarms me.  We were at church on Sunday for Jenny's nephews baptism.  There were several occasions where the parish applauded.  Whenever Quin heard it, he clapped as well!  I didn't even know he knew how to clap!  At one point during the mass, Quin had fallen asleep and another applause broke out.  He woke up and tried to put his hands together to show his appreciation, but was just a little too tired to stay awake long enough...</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/6835031454081386308/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=6835031454081386308' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/6835031454081386308'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/6835031454081386308'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2008/10/big-strides.html' title='Big Strides'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-9058677303325296381</id><published>2008-10-08T16:50:00.003-05:00</published><updated>2008-10-08T16:55:15.206-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><title type='text'>It's Official!!!</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SO0rSaKzGxI/AAAAAAAAAUE/q7y7qHFOOLI/s1600-h/IMG_4800.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SO0rSaKzGxI/AAAAAAAAAUE/q7y7qHFOOLI/s320/IMG_4800.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5254903935473490706" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;That's right, Quin's a Grady!  Poor kid...  On October 2, 2008, we had our final court date at the Waukesha County Juvenile Court to finalize, legally, our adoption.  Largely it was uneventful, but it still managed to choke me up a little bit.  While there we met another family that was finalizing, except this was their THIRD adoption!  Crazy folks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quin's getting bigger and moving around more and more all the time.  Today, I'm proud to say, he said his first word that I could understand.  Jenny was telling me that daycare said that Quin had been saying "dada" lately.  When he heard her say that, he promptly said "dada" to us.  We're working on "mama," but hey, the kid knows what he likes!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/9058677303325296381/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=9058677303325296381' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/9058677303325296381'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/9058677303325296381'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2008/10/its-official.html' title='It&apos;s Official!!!'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SO0rSaKzGxI/AAAAAAAAAUE/q7y7qHFOOLI/s72-c/IMG_4800.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-7844251871733477580</id><published>2008-09-29T19:40:00.003-05:00</published><updated>2008-09-29T19:45:02.247-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><title type='text'>Catching up.</title><content type='html'>I know that I'm getting  behind because my wife has told me that I'm in trouble because of how infrequently I blog.

No, he still doesn't (really) crawl, but has developed a rolling technique that enables him to get pretty much wherever he wants to go.  He's also started to try out the "all fours" thing by getting up on his knees and lunching towards things that are slightly out of his reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm pretty sure I've written about this in the past, but I have a feeling that we're going to be in a bit of trouble in our household before too long.  Quin appears to be taking after his big brother in the talking department.  He is capable of babbling on and on for minutes on end.  He also manages to use several consonant and vowel sounds.  On occasion he will even try to mimic something that somebody else is saying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wednesday marks our court date.  After that, Quin will be a bonafide Grady at long last.

He "fared" pretty well, though I'm not sure it was entirely his cup of tea just yet.  Ethan had a blast, at least for the most part.  We started out by getting a wrist band and going on the rides.  This is really the first year where Ethan was ready to go on the "big kids" rides.  Unfortunately we were there with Micky and her kids, and they aren't quite ready.  Not to worry, we split up for an hour and allowed Ethan to go on several rides by himself, and he had a blast.  He even got to go on the bumper cars while I talked with a couple of Chicago guys waiting for their kids.  The only things he was not able to go on were the rides that had a 52 inch height limit.  Apparently he isn't quite 50 inches yet.  Guess the NBA isn't necessarily in his future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SKOiYYdrbRI/AAAAAAAAAOw/_-aDyISvxH4/s1600-h/IMG_4583.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SKOiYYdrbRI/AAAAAAAAAOw/_-aDyISvxH4/s320/IMG_4583.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5234205731702140178" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;After the rides, we grabbed some dinner then went through the animal barns, like you are supposed to at the State Fair!  Ethan's definitely a city boy.  He was amazed that the cows would poop wherever they were.  He also told me that this goat had its udders in the wrong place!  Then there were the "racing sheep" that had blankets on them.  To be honest, I suppose they could have been racing sheep for all I know.  I don't know why they where those blankets!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quin is doing very well now-a-days.  He is now able to roll in both directions, which sounds great in theory, but is a bit of a pain in reality.  This means that he is mobile, to a certain degree.  I placed him on the floor in our living room the other day and went into the kitchen for something.  When I returned some minutes later, he had migrated to the other end of the floor and was playing with the coffee table!  I just can't wait until he can crawl or walk!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SKOiYD-PJuI/AAAAAAAAAOo/kyTh1_c1ZOM/s1600-h/IMG_4577.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SKOiYD-PJuI/AAAAAAAAAOo/kyTh1_c1ZOM/s320/IMG_4577.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5234205726201554658" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The last few nights, Quin has treated us with full nights of sleep!  10 hours minimum for 3 nights straight!

Quin is starting to get more and more independent, which is nice as he was being a bit clingy for awhile there.  He is very good at rolling and can sometimes even roll from his back to his stomach.  His latest trick is to stay in a seated position if we put him in one to start with.  He's also reaching for toys and other things that are out of reach, which I'm told is a developmental milestone.  So way to go, Quin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethan has had a couple of funny situations in the last few days.  First, we were over at Tony and Michelle's, Ethan's aunt and uncle's for a birthday party.  Many of Jenny's family members were outside being eaten by mosquitoes and playing cornhole, when a policeman pulled into the driveway.  Apparently a 911 call was made from a cell phone at this address, so they were coming to check it out.  Well, I guess Tony's sister knew the guy, so she invited him in to look at Tony's shed.  While he was touring the place, Ethan came up to me and said, "Dad, it's cool to have a cop at your party, don't you think?"  I told him he probably won't think so in 9-10 years...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to yesterday (that sounds kind of funny, doesn't it?), Ethan had some friends over the day prior to play Wii and look at Ethan's new Bakugon - a Pokemon knockoff.  One of his friends apparently asked if he could keep one of his characters, but Ethan said no.  Well, yesterday Ethan was looking for his little guys and could not find them.  He immediately assumed that one of his buddies took it.  He became suddenly obsessed with finding the toy, looking all over the upstairs.  After about 5 minutes of furious looking, he said loudly, "where the hell did they put them?"  After my initial shock, I calmly told him that that word was not appropriate for kids to say.  He seemed to accept that, but called us out on using those words...  Guess it's time to start watching our language again.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/8666281982665942054/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=8666281982665942054' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/8666281982665942054'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/8666281982665942054'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2008/07/where-hell-did-they-put-them.html' title='&quot;Where the hell did they put them?&quot;'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://lh6.ggpht.com/grady.mke/SJJwjPdvhQI/AAAAAAAAALI/jsVaUk_MRG8/s72-c/IMG_4546.JPG?imgmax=720' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-8690175573869780347</id><published>2008-07-13T20:18:00.003-05:00</published><updated>2008-07-13T20:29:06.999-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Ethan'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Triathlon'/><title type='text'>Ethan the Triathlete</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SHqq0gOrcmI/AAAAAAAAAKo/7auCkSsTX6M/s1600-h/IMG_4458.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SHqq0gOrcmI/AAAAAAAAAKo/7auCkSsTX6M/s320/IMG_4458.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5222674536870933090" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This past weekend was the Pewaukee Sprint Triathlon.  I ran in this event last year along with a team that we had assembled known as "Big Sky Multisport."  We had our own jerseys and a whole bunch of people.  Ethan was so impressed when he came to watch!  He wanted to be "on my team."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year we did it again, and they have a kid's event.  So I ordered Ethan a jersey and he competed in the kid's triathlon.  Well, it was actually a duathlon this year since we've had so much rain this summer that the lake where we swim is closed with algae problems...  At any rate, Ethan is now offiially a Big Sky Multisport member.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first gave Ethan his jersey, he wore it everywhere!  Of course, the jerseys are made of some sort of moisture absorbing, space-age material or something, and they don't always agree with the wearer's body parts.  After Ethan wore his for awhile, his nipples started to get very sore.  So before his race on Saturday, he asked me to put some band-aids over his nipples so the shirt wouldn't irritate them.  They worked like a charm, but he forgot to take off the band-aids when he got home, then went to a friend's house to go swimming.  His friend's mom told me that she knew quite a bit more about Ethan's nipples than she ever wanted to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quin's doing very well, also.  Jenny and I had to get up early this morning for our race (at 4:30) and it was my night to get up with Quin.  I was very happy when I woke up at 4:30 and found that I hadn't been interrupted in my sleep the past night!  He may not sleep through the night consistently, but he seems to know when it's imperitive to do so.  He's also added the raspberry sound to his ramblings, which is pretty funny.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/8690175573869780347/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=8690175573869780347' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/8690175573869780347'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/8690175573869780347'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2008/07/ethan-triathlete.html' title='Ethan the Triathlete'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SHqq0gOrcmI/AAAAAAAAAKo/7auCkSsTX6M/s72-c/IMG_4458.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-4454667712196951267</id><published>2008-07-06T20:09:00.003-05:00</published><updated>2008-07-06T20:16:30.927-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><title type='text'>Milestones</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SHFuZi6mK0I/AAAAAAAAAKg/fpkOrkDJC4A/s1600-h/IMG_4358.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SHFuZi6mK0I/AAAAAAAAAKg/fpkOrkDJC4A/s320/IMG_4358.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5220074828247477058" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having been read the riot act by my mother, I have decided to finally make a most delayed post.  In the past two weeks, Quin has been passing milestones by the handful and I have neglected to document them here, so here goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks ago Friday, Quin passed not one, not two, but three milestones in a 12 hour period.  First, he ate rice cereal for the first time, and gobbled it up completely.  I mean, he really liked it!  Next, after his meal, Brett and I put him on the floor and he was observed for the first time rolling over (he had previously rolled over in bed two times, but this was the first time another human saw him).  To top off the act, Quin slept for 9.5 hours that night from 8:30 to 6:00!!!  That was the big one in my book!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, two weeks later, Quin is eating cereal and fruit on a daily basis.  He has eaten pears and bananas so far and has really liked both of them.  He also rolls over ALL THE TIME!  It's actually to the point where we have to watch him more closely because he is starting to use it as a means of propulsion.  Unfortunately, the last item on the list hasn't taken quite as quickly.  He has ripped off a couple of 8-9 hour sleep nights in the intervening time, but has also reverted oddly back to the 4 hours sleep and up pattern at times.  That is VERY frustrating as he has set a high water mark now and I expect that to be met on a nightly basis!  I guess I haven't reached too many of my milestones as a second parent yet, unfortunately.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/4454667712196951267/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=4454667712196951267' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/4454667712196951267'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/4454667712196951267'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2008/07/milestones.html' title='Milestones'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SHFuZi6mK0I/AAAAAAAAAKg/fpkOrkDJC4A/s72-c/IMG_4358.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-6157845272632843797</id><published>2008-06-11T20:52:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2008-06-11T20:54:06.356-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><title type='text'>Dexterity</title><content type='html'>I'm just sitting here doing some scout stuff and Quin is sitting right next to me in one of his bouncy chairs.

 He insisted that he was in no shape to go to the party.  We drove to where we were going to meet to discuss with hosts, one of who was a dentist no less, all the while Ethan was crying in the back seat.  Luckily for us, the party was postponed due to inclement weather.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Let's back up.  It has been raining here in Milwaukee for the last 4-5 days straight.  I'm not talking about Seattle showers, I'm talking about torrential downpours.  There is standing water to spare, and flooding is the norm rather than the exception.  Today I saw a statistic that we've gotten over 9 inches of rain in June, already making it the third highest precipitation accumulation for June ever, and it's only the 9th.  What's more, our average rainfall for the entire summer is 11 inches...  On Saturday, there were several tornadoes spotted and detected with radar, high winds, inch hail, you know, basic apocalypse stuff.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SE3sNYq8MJI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/N5G60yrVyug/s320/IMG_4332.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5210080058642542738" /&gt;&lt;div&gt;So the party was postponed.  No problem.  That should give Ethan some time to recover and he should still be able to go to the party later.  After we met with Tatum's parents, we were asked to check out Aimee and Steve's basement for water.  They were away for the weekend and had troubles with water in their basement in the past, so they are a bit sensitive.  We agreed and took the trip over to Ixonia to check out their basement.  On the way, Ethan managed to work his front tooth out!  We were very proud that he managed to stop crying long enough to do so.  What's more, during the 15 minute trip over to the house, he managed to work the other front tooth out without so much as a whimper.  "Yes!!!"  He exclaimed as the second tooth lost root in his mouth.  Hopefully he will remember this next time a tooth gets loose and bleeds a little bit!  Anyway, now he has no front teeth.  You can see for yourself how he looks!  What's funnier is to hear him talk.  He's not too bad, but you can tell he has some troubles with "s" and "th" sounds.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SE3yfVxmMLI/AAAAAAAAAKM/dU0LhLYfYJQ/s1600-h/IMG_4337.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SE3yfVxmMLI/AAAAAAAAAKM/dU0LhLYfYJQ/s320/IMG_4337.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5210086964172566706" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;Crisis averted!  The rest of the day went innocently enough.  Ethan bragged constantly about how he pulled two teeth.  We found jobs to do in the house because the sky had opened up yet again with some more rain.  Eventually, the rain stopped for a bit and we decided to grill out.  After supper, we were giving the boys baths when I noticed that Quin was feeling quite warm.  I didn't think much of it, and gave him a bath, thinking it would cool him down.  Well, about 30 minutes later, Jenny noticed how warm he felt, so we (read Jenny) decided we should take his temperature.  Imagine our surprise to see the thermometer reading 103!!!  OK, Tylenol, the doctor said we could give it to him, so we did that.  Unfortunately that wasn't enough for Jenny, she wanted a doctor to see him.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Gone are the days when we could both get in the car and worry equally about our baby at the doctor, we have another baby at home that needs to go to school the next day.  So I drew the short straw (because it was Jenny's night to put Ethan to bed) and headed out to the emergency room at 7:45PM, right as the sky had opened up again for another barrage of water.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Apparently Sunday is the busiest day in the ER in Oconomowoc, because I couldn't find a parking spot.  So I parked in the front only to find that the front doors were locked at 8:00 on Sunday.  It was 8:03.  So around the building I walked with Quin, a diaper bag, and a big umbrella that was struggling to do its job.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The ER was not entirely that interesting, but let me hit in the highlights.  Quin was feeling quite a bit better after the Tylenol, but the doctors wanted to make sure they checked thoroughly for anything they could treat.  They started checking the ears.  Once that yielded no results, they did a chest X-ray, followed by urine and blood samples.  I was wondering how they were going to get urine from a baby, like if they would try to squeeze it out of the diaper...  Nope.  Catheter baby!  I couldn't watch.  In all, we were there for just shy of 4 hours and found out that there was nothing treatable wrong with him and we should just give him Tylenol.  While we were there, I did get to hear some interesting conversations from people trying to score some narcotics from the ER staff as well as some woman involved in what sounded like a horrible car accident, so the night wasn't a complete loss.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Around midnight, Quin and I rolled into the driveway.  It was still raining, and the storm was picking up.  As soon as we walked in the door, the power cut out!  No problem, I knew where the flashlights were, so I was able to get the house prepared for the night.  Of course, one of our babies was sick, so we had to sleep upstairs.  As soon as I hit the pillow, I was out.  The power had still not yet come back on.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When the morning arrived, things appeared normal again.  Quin's fever had not spiked like it had the night prior, the power was back on, and it had finally stopped pouring rain (it was still sprinkling).  After getting breakfast ready for Ethan, I went to get his toothbrush ready and found out that we had very low water pressure.  I figured immediately that we must have thrown a breaker on the water pump, so I went downstairs to check it out.  I'm not sure what possessed me to check the sump pump.  It has never run a single time in the 5 years we've lived here.  In fact, it has been bone dry!  Not this morning.  The water in the sump was up to the brim!  I can't believe it didn't come out.  The pump was working just as hard as it could, but it was fighting a losing battle.  I guess I'm not going to work today!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After a while, I realized that I needed to divert the water deeper into the yard as it was collecting right next to the house.  That seemed to appease the drain tile for awhile, but the pump just kept on working, and working, and working.  At one point, worrying that the old pump wouldn't make it, I went out and bought a new pump just in case.  Turns out that was a wise decision.  I bought the new pump at 8:30 AM.  One of my neighbors went to the same place I bought mine an hour later to find they were completely sold out!  Oh, and the pump came in handy.  With two pumps going, I was able to finally get ahead of the water coming into the sump, at least briefly.  But the water was still coming in at an alarming rate.  It was like somebody hooked up a fire hydrant line to my drain tiles.  As I sit here at 10:00 PM, the sump pump is still working more than it is resting.  Apparently the ground has reached its maximum tolerance for water and the rest was going to follow the path of least resistance, which was my drain tile.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I don't know the end of this story yet, but my nerves are about shot.  I'm going to try to get some sleep if I can.  I'm sure I'll dream of breakers flipping and basements flooding, and that will prompt me to once again go into the basement to look at the sump pump doing its job.  At least the tooth fairy was good to Ethan and Quin's fever broke, though.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SE3ygKCtQ5I/AAAAAAAAAKU/4XoDHXpC2MM/s1600-h/IMG_4335.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SE3ygKCtQ5I/AAAAAAAAAKU/4XoDHXpC2MM/s320/IMG_4335.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5210086978202977170" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/4721768348512358119/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=4721768348512358119' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/4721768348512358119'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/4721768348512358119'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2008/06/rough-36-hours.html' title='A rough 36 hours...'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SE3sNYq8MJI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/N5G60yrVyug/s72-c/IMG_4332.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-485384068105442927</id><published>2008-05-18T20:28:00.004-05:00</published><updated>2008-05-18T21:15:21.316-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Birthday'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Ethan'/><title type='text'>The "Forrest" is strong with this one...</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SDDZhfyu9HI/AAAAAAAAAJM/ZYpzhNXwI6E/s1600-h/IMG_4278.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SDDZhfyu9HI/AAAAAAAAAJM/ZYpzhNXwI6E/s320/IMG_4278.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5201896739106124914" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Birthday Boy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;May 17th was Ethan's 7th birthday.  To celebrate, we invited the boys from his class to join us at the YMCA for some cake, games, and swimming.  Unfortunately, Ethan has only 5 boys in his class, including himself.  Even more unfortunate, one of the boys didn't show up, so there were only 4 boys there.  Actually, that ended up being lucky for us as boys are crazy!  The spent the bulk of their time wrestling and smashing into one another.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We did manage to get them all into the pool in one piece.  Our Y has a very nice family pool that is separate from the competitive "lap" pool.  It has a small lazy river, therapeutic area, a play area with fun water toys, and a big water slide.  Ethan's always been afraid of the water slides, which is too bad since we go to the Dells at least twice a year in hopes that he'll start going down them.  Each time we've gone, we've been disappointed.  We tried everything.  We picked out any 3 year old girl that was going on the slides and point them out, we'd question his manhood, but nothing would work.  He was very stubborn.  Finally we thought we had found something that would work to get him to go on waterslides, movies.  He loves movies, particularly Spiderman and Star Wars.  We have not let him watch the Star Wars III and Spiderman 3 because they were PG-13 and that made him mad!  His friends got to watch them, he would tell us, to which we would retort, "your friends probably aren't afraid to go down waterslides."  Yes, nominate us for parents of the year right now...  So we told him that if he would go down a waterslide, we would let him watch one of those movies.  Well, he finally went down the waterslide at the Y, not because he wanted to watch a movie, but because all of his friends did it and he felt like he should as well.  He did not hesitate to tell me immediately, though, that he intended on watching Star Wars Episode III that very evening.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px;" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/07/EP3_Poster.jpg" border="0" alt="" /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Episode III&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ethan has been a fan of Star Wars for quite some time.  He has recently renewed his love for the movies when he discovered Lego Star Wars, the Wii video game, a couple of weeks ago.  Since then we have watched all 5 episodes (besides Episode III) several times.  Watching the movies with Ethan means enduring a constant barrage of questions and comments about the movies.  As late as three weeks ago, he still referred to the "Force" as the "Forrest."  It was all I could do to answer him with a straight face when he would ask me, "Dad, do you believe in the Forrest?"  He finally conceded that it was the "Force" after some heated arguments and re-viewings of the movies.  All that time, though, we insisted that Episode III was too dark and scary for him to watch.  The fact that it was rated PG-13 helped us to convince him that he couldn't watch it.  After surprising us by going down the waterslide, though, we had no choice but to let him watch.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After the party, we quickly went to church (fun birthday, eh?), went out to eat at one of his favorite restaurants, Burger King, then rushed home, got into our pajamas, popped some popcorn, and settled down to watch Episode III.  It had been awhile since Jenny and I had watched the movie as well, so we were excited to watch the movie as well.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My impressions of watching the movie with Ethan are mixed.  On one hand, I thought he had an incredible amount of insight in the movie.  He understood many things that I never would have thought he would understand.  For example, he figured out early that the Chancellor was only pretending to be kidnapped.  On the other hand, he never shut up for the entire movie!  Over the last few weeks, since the Star Wars craze started up again, he had been barraging me with questions about Episode III.  I told him what I remembered and never left anything out.  From that, he was able to predict a good portion of the movie.  It was pretty annoying, though, because he would constantly be saying, "Is this the part where &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;such and such&lt;/span&gt;?"  I'm sure there was not an entire minute during the movie where he didn't say something.  One thing that he said that I found hilarious was during a scene where Anikan and Padme were talking about what they were going to do with the baby that they had accidentally created together.  Padme said something like, "Do you think Obi-Wan could help?"  Ethan started snickering to himself, so I had to ask him why.  He said, "I'm thinking how funny it would be if Obi-Wan helped with the baby.  Like if the baby got stuck coming out, he could use his light-saber..."  Perhaps the PG-13 rating should have scared me away.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the end, I'm glad I let him watch the movie.  He actually is very good at following these movies, perhaps even better than some adults (myself included).  He has a very good attention to detail and is not afraid to ask questions about anything that comes to mind.  The bad part, of course, is that he asks it when it comes to his mind, regardless of whether it is during the movie.  One of his favorite questions is, "who is your favorite character" and all variations around it.  An example of his variations on this question is "who is your favorite bad guy in the second episode?"  Ultimately, he wants me to say either Boba or Jango Fett, his two favorite characters in all the episodes...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SDDZh_yu9II/AAAAAAAAAJU/S_4jLyYF3nE/s320/IMG_4211.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5201896747696059522" /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Quick Quin Update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I feel bad that I've not written much on Quin lately.  It seems that the second child syndrome has set in.  Reading back on the blog entries on Ethan, I wrote at length on gripping topics as the consistency of his bowel movements to the exact pitch and tone of his coughs.  With Quin, however, we have been through that, and we choose not to worry ourselves about it so much.  There, another reason to get that nomination in for parents of the year!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Quin is progressing as one would expect a three month old to progress, I think.  He has become quite interactive.  He rewards us often with smiles and laughs.  He is also starting to discover that he can grab things with his hands and explore them.  Right now he is very hesitant and cautious about grabbing things, and is still trying to get the hang of controlling his limbs to such a fine degree.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He's still eating about 5 ounces at a time every 4 hours or so.  He has started sleeping a bit more at night, but it's not very predictable.  He has gone 9 hours before eating at night in the past week, but that 9 hours went from 6PM to 3AM.  Eventually we'll figure out how to get him on somewhat of a schedule.  It is more common for him to go 6 hours between eating at night, and he still goes to sleep almost instantly after eating when in the middle of the night.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Oh, he talks a lot!  I'm not sure if I'm ready for another kid that talks as much as Ethan!  The funny thing is that I really believe he thinks that he is talking.  He will look you in the eye, smile, then babble at you for minutes on end.  He repeats sounds sometimes as well!  I'm wondering if those repeated sounds actually mean something?  Do babies come out with some sort of default language that they all speak and we just don't understand it?  I always thought all babies came out speaking a Chinese dialect since they had about a 1 in 4 chance of being born in China, but now I'm not so sure.  The things Quin is saying don't sound Chinese to me...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;At any rate, Quin's doing well.  I'll update more as more exciting things occur to him, like getting teeth, rolling over, eating his first solid food, you know, the really exciting stuff!!!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/485384068105442927/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=485384068105442927' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/485384068105442927'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/485384068105442927'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2008/05/forrest-is-strong-with-this-one.html' title='The &quot;Forrest&quot; is strong with this one...'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SDDZhfyu9HI/AAAAAAAAAJM/ZYpzhNXwI6E/s72-c/IMG_4278.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-1328577559459551595</id><published>2008-05-04T20:33:00.004-05:00</published><updated>2008-05-04T20:39:42.430-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Ethan'/><title type='text'>Superheroes</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SB5k_9bcA9I/AAAAAAAAAGU/l1FNe50mduc/s1600-h/250px-Spider-girl-continues.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SB5k_9bcA9I/AAAAAAAAAGU/l1FNe50mduc/s320/250px-Spider-girl-continues.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5196702070016312274" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's not secret, Ethan is a HUGE superhero fan.  He loves all things Spider-man, Superman (to a lesser degree), Batman, Fast Guy, who he now knows as The Flash, you name it.  He even thinks Ghost Rider and Blade are cool.  On Friday, he had a book fair at school where he become the proud new owner of a Spider-man encyclopedia.  It is a book that has many of the characters from the Spider-man universe, gives a brief dossier on the character, and shows a picture.  He was very excited to show me "Spider-girl" from the book.  In fact, he told me that he &lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;"&gt;had &lt;/span&gt;Spider-girl in his collection!

 Not to worry.  The resort we were staying at had indoor facilities which we fully intended to utilize.  Despite the weather, Friday night went off without a hitch.  Everybody got up there safely and the sleeping arrangements were more than adequate.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SBkRjdbcA7I/AAAAAAAAAGE/vXN2wHwHNao/s320/IMG_4186.JPG" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5195202946041381810" /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Saturday was nice also.  We spent a large portion of the day in various wave pools and water play areas, no problem.  The real fun didn't begin until later in the evening, after a healthy taco meal!  It started right at the tail end of supper, actually.  Ethan started complaining a bit about his stomach not feeling well.  We just assumed he had jumped on one too many lilly pads and discounted it.  I ushered him into our room to get him ready for bed.  Before he could get there, though, he gave a bit of a squeak, ran into the hallway, and threw up everywhere.  He managed to get about 1/2 of the seemingly endless supply of vomit into the tiled bathroom, but there was still a healthy supply on the carpeted hallway.  While Jenny settled him down and cleaned him up, I got the puke from the carpet as best as I could.  At this point we were still dismissing this as overexposure to the water park.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Fast forward two hours.  By this time, Ethan had thrown up all over both of our beds and sheets.  At this point, we knew that it wasn't overexposure and it was indeed some sort of bug.  Not having a bed to sleep in anymore, we decided to head home around 11:30 in the evening.  Before we could go, our friend Tim suffered a similar fate to Ethan's.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The ride home was uneventful, if you don't count Jenny having to hold a plastic bag in front of Ethan to catch the various bouts of vomiting.  To make a long story just a little bit shorter, we got home, Jenny threw up, I lasted a couple more hours before I got sick, and Quin seemed to weather it all without incident.  Unfortunately for him, none of us were able to get up or do anything until about 4:00 the next day.  Luckily he slept a large portion of that time.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So yeah, Quin's second family vacation was probably not too memorable for him.  The rest of us will remember it, though!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/7306020045542442633/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=7306020045542442633' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/7306020045542442633'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/7306020045542442633'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2008/04/one-rough-vacation.html' title='One Rough Vacation'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SBkSC9bcA8I/AAAAAAAAAGM/igMQ-L4p3s4/s72-c/IMG_4175.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-7615897857486959199</id><published>2008-04-22T08:58:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2008-04-22T09:06:45.252-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><title type='text'>Big Update</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SA3vOtbcA5I/AAAAAAAAAF0/ITD1U0eMXLU/s1600-h/IMG_4132.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SA3vOtbcA5I/AAAAAAAAAF0/ITD1U0eMXLU/s320/IMG_4132.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5192068981419934610" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Quin is 9 weeks old now!!!  We've had a good couple of weeks with him so I thought I'd share with the lot of you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, he's now eating about 5 ounces at a time every 4 hours.  Unfortunately, he's still doing that at night as well.  Although, some nights he's been known to go 6 or more hours between feedings, and when he does wake up to eat, he's very good about going back to sleep promptly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next in line, Quin has started to smile.  Up until now, smiles were pretty elusive, but as of today he's doling them out to deserving individuals on a regular basis.  Here you see him smiling at his mommy while Grandma Grady holds on to him.  Last Thursday, he was really giving it to his Grandpa Tibbett while giving him an earful at the same time.  Yes, it seems to be that we have another talker on our hands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last Thursday, Quin had his 2 month well baby checkup.  He weighed in at 12 pounds 1/2 ounce and was 23 1/2 inches tall.  That qualifies him for the 50th percentile in each category.  He also got his first booster shots, which he really didn't like at all!  Jenny and I heard a cry from him that we hadn't heard to that point.  He was really mad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, we took Quin to meet the rest of my family last weekend as my brother, Bryce, got married in Minnesota.  He was a big hit, as we knew he would be.  Lucky for us, he is a very good rider as we had a 6 hour drive from Minnesota to our home.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/7615897857486959199/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=7615897857486959199' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/7615897857486959199'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/7615897857486959199'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2008/04/big-update.html' title='Big Update'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/SA3vOtbcA5I/AAAAAAAAAF0/ITD1U0eMXLU/s72-c/IMG_4132.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-6664254642580187161</id><published>2008-03-30T21:39:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2008-04-03T21:50:53.965-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Vacation'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Ethan'/><title type='text'>The Trip Home</title><content type='html'>&lt;span style="font-size:130%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;The Trip Home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 6:30 we got up "officially."  Jenny had packed the night before so we could maximize our sleep, but Quin had different ideas.  By 7:30 we were showered and ready to go.  A bellman picked us up at our room and took us to the "Common House" for checkout.  Here we were actually able to check our bags onto the airplane and get our boarding passes.  This Magical Express thing was really nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trip to the airport was short and sweet.  The driver did his best to get us in a good mood, but nothing could change the fact that we were about to reenter the real world in less than 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the airport, we grabbed a bit of breakfast then went over for the body cavity search line which looked to be significant.  Orlando is perhaps the least friendly airport I've ever been in.  We had a stroller and a 6 year old, but were afforded no slack in getting through the security line.  First we were yelled at because our stroller didn't collapse small enough, then we were yelled at because I was trying to hold Quin in one hand while replacing my belt and shoes with the other, all the while my bags were still on the conveyor.  Pricks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We made it to the gate quickly enough that we had to wait for almost an hour.  Mom tried to find Ethan some gum as I had lost hers on the way there.  She was unable to locate any.  So if you are travling to Orlando and need gum to fly, buy it before you get to the airport.  The worst part of the trip was that we were sitting all over the airplane.  Apparently they had overbooked the flight by 4 passengers.  I'm not sure how we got so split up since we checked in 3 hours prior to the departure, but I suppose everybody else paid the $10 to select their seats.  As it was, I had to trade with some other person in order to sit next to Ethan.  Luckily he was very nice and traded with me.  Jenny, on the other hand, had to fend for herself with Quin three rows in front of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we finally got home, collected our luggage, and drove back to Oconomowoc, it was around 3:00.  We purchased a pizza since we didn't have anything to eat at home, cooked, ate, and unpacked, then mom and dad headed home for Neillsville.  Our vacation was officially over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Trip Summary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, it was a wonderful vacation.  We would do it again, though perhaps not over spring break.  The Saturday was much less crowded than the other days, so perhaps including an entire weekend would be good one way or the other.  I would definitely recommend going to Disney, particularly if your parents or inlaws were willing to pay for it (thanks mom and dad!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;"&gt;Insiders Tips for the Disney Traveler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Here is a list of things that we've found that will make your trip to Disney just that much better: &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay on the resort.  It may appear to cost more, but it is  much nicer.  There is no need to worry about parking, transportation, accommodations, and they pick you up and drop you off at the airport.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get the meal plan.  It is much cheaper.  Quick service meals  average around $12 and table service meals around $25 per person  without the plan.  It's nice not to have to worry about paying for  meals.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can buy alcohol at the shops.   It's expensive, but  cheaper than getting it in the bars.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plan ahead.  It takes around an hour to get from any one  place on the resort to any other place as long as you don't have to  switch modes of transportation.  If you have to switch, plan more  time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to do pin trading, purchase pins before coming to  the park.  You can apparently purchase them on Ebay for a fraction  of the cost.  Pins cost between $6 and $10 from what I've seen,  though they could be more or less.  All you need is some to start  and you can trade with any Disney employee, who are required to  trade unless they already have one that you are trying to trade.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In EPCOT, there are kids stations all over the park that kids  can stop and get a badge and a stamp.   It's something fun for them  to do and may buy you a couple of minutes to look around.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get dinner reservations in advance.   It's hard to get reservations  at normal meal times otherwise.  You can make reservations up to 6 months in advance of your vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal Kingdom and Hollywood Studios are less attended than  other parks and may get you out of the hustle and bustle.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downtown Disney isn't really all that cool.  They do have  nice bars, though.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do a character meal.  Your kids will like it more than you  think they will.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/6664254642580187161/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=6664254642580187161' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/6664254642580187161'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/6664254642580187161'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2008/03/trip-home.html' title='The Trip Home'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-4673522320009323155</id><published>2008-03-29T21:31:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2008-04-03T21:38:37.767-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Vacation'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Ethan'/><title type='text'>Disney Day 5</title><content type='html'>&lt;span style="font-size:130%;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Morning Swim&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, our last day at the parks.  It's been a pretty eventful week.  A bit tiring, but definitely memorable.  Today we had reservations at EPCOT early, 4:45, so we planned on spending the day there again.  There was a lot at this park that we haven't yet done.  Also, mom and dad really like the world showcase, so there seemed plenty to do for the entire family.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We woke up late again today.  It was a bit of a rough night with Quin.  He had been very good all week up until, and for the most part including tonight.  This time, though, he was up a little bit in the night, not awake, but fussing.  It made it a bit difficult to get really good sleep.  Ethan didn't have any troubles, though, which was all that really mattered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since we got up later anyway, Ethan and I decided to go for a quick swim when there was nobody in the pool.  We had some fun playing Marco-Polo and Leech, but also got to do some aerial stunts.  Specifically, I threw Ethan in the air and he did flips.  He was surprisingly good at them, so that was pretty enjoyable.  Of course you can only do that if nobody else is in the pool with you, especially a life guard.  This morning, all of those conditions were met.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After a quick serve breakfast, we caught the bus to EPCOT.  Quin and I got to ride with a woman and her grandchild who were from Menominee Falls and Slinger respectively.  They were very nice people.  The grandmother was only 54 years old and was there with her daughter and granddaughter only.  Grandpa had stayed home to run the family business that they had just sold the year prior.  He had a two year contract to continue working there until he was going to retire at 55.  They had a house in Arizona and one up by Wisconsin Rapids where they planned to spend their retirement.  I envy them...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Epcot Take III – Ethan, Jenny, and Brandon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We got to EPCOT around 11:00 and decided to split up.  Jenny, Ethan, and I were going to try to get on some rides in Futureworld while Grandma, Grandpa, and Quin were going to take in the World Showcase.  After splitting up, I took all of our passes and Fast Passed Soarin'.  Even though I was early, our Fast Pass tickets didn't come due until after 3:00.  No problem.  We were planning on meeting mom and dad around 1:00, so we could all go and check it out.  The bad part was that there were 2 hours until we could Fast Pass again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_WUSFNK-WI/AAAAAAAAAFU/UbKlt_zXtg4/s1600-h/Disney+220.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_WUSFNK-WI/AAAAAAAAAFU/UbKlt_zXtg4/s320/Disney+220.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5185213584342972770" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Knowing that, we headed over to the other side of the park to see if we could get on Mission: Space or Test Track.  The line for Mission: Space was only 20 minutes long, but Ethan didn't really want to go on that.  Instead, we got into line for Test Track, which was 60 minutes long, but we didn't have anywhere to go anyway.  GM sponsored this ride, and the line decorations were pretty neat.  They had different stations that explained different stages of actual test tracks.  They also had some literature of one of their actual test track centers in Michigan where they had over 100 miles of specifically designed roads in which to test their cars.  While in line, we got to see how Disney measures the length of their lines.  It appears to be an automated system.  At the front of the line is a box.  When that box beeps, an attendant goes over and grabs one of may red lanyards and scans it at the box.  They then give this lanyard to the next person that gets into line.  When that person gets to the front, another attendant takes the lanyard and scans it again, and viola, line time is determined.  It is really very accurate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The ride was very cool.  Six of us got into a car that took us through several test courses.  Of course they had the mandatory orientation video with a famous person giving the talk.  I think this person was the guy from A Mighty Wind and Best in Show.  Anyway, the different agility and brake tests were all fine, but the real fun started when they took us on the outdoor track and sped up to somewhere around 100 MPH.  I'm just guessing on the time, I don't really know how fast we were going, but it seemed very fast and was very fun.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_WUSFNK-XI/AAAAAAAAAFc/qysE6Fbl4oM/s1600-h/Disney+226.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_WUSFNK-XI/AAAAAAAAAFc/qysE6Fbl4oM/s320/Disney+226.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5185213584342972786" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;After Test Track, our Fast Pass was available to use again, so we fast passed Mission: Space under the guise that there is a kids and and adult version of the ride, which there is.  We had about 40 minutes to wait for that, so we tried to get on the Universe of Energy ride which was 40 minutes long and we walked right onto.  After an 8 minute introductory video, they opened the doors to reveal an area with many church-pew looking benches.  After getting about half way into that area, Ethan decided we weren't going to go on that ride and tried to leave.  After getting about half way out the exit, he decided we could go on it, and we went back in.  Half-way in again, he decided finally that this wasn't the ride for us, and we left for good.  Oh well.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead, we spent some time in a playground and in the Walt Disney Flower and Garden Exhibit Pavilion, which had a bunch of flower and garden stuff.  While there we saw a video that detailed the making of some of the various topiaries around the park.  These things are amazingly detailed as you have seen in some of our pictures.  All of the matter that goes into these topiaries is organic and they don't use any paint as far as I can tell.  It also underscored just how many people work for this company as there were dozens that worked on these topiaries alone, not to mention the greenhouse, modeling, and welding people that all coordinate to make these structures.  These things are so complex that they have their own internal irrigation systems!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At last, it was time for us to go into Mission: Space.  At the beginning of the Fast Pass line, one of the “Cast” asked us if we wanted the Green or Orange experience.  Green was for “babies,” he said, or orange for “big boys.”  I said, “I think he can handle it,” referring to Ethan.  He said it wasn't Ethan he was worried about.  An astute observation.  Under the guise of color-blindness, I told him we would go on the orange, while still convincing Jenny and Ethan we were going on the beginners ride.  When we finally got in, Jenny caught on to the fact that we were on the adult ride, but Ethan still didn't know.  It didn't matter.  He loved it.  The ride itself was pretty amazing.  They put you in this spaceship in astronaut couches.  You are strapped in so that you can see a screen and some controls in front of you.  On the screen they show a movie.  It starts on the launch pad and simulates G-force for takeoff that was very realistic.  As far as I could tell, they rotated the cabins and spun them to do the simulation.  Very cool.  This went on for another 5 minutes or so when we finally landed on Mars with a dramatic landing on the edge of a cliff.  After getting off, I explained to Ethan that it was the adult ride.  It turned out to be his favorite ride in any park!  Jenny, on the other hand, was not so impressed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We still had an hour or so before our Fast Pass for Soarin' came available.  We had long since called mom and dad to coordinate a later meeting time, so we went to the Journey into Imagination with Figment.  This was a pretty lame ride that had a dragon in it and was hosted by Eric Idle.  Nothing too great here.  Outside of this building were the dancing fountains that Ethan was so fond of, so we messed around there for awhile.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At last it was time for Soarin'.  Jenny wasn't feeling too well from Mission: Space, so Ethan and I went in alone.  This time he wasn't scared at all!  Hopefully something on Mission: Space convinced him that these rides weren't that scary.  The ride itself was pretty cool.  They put you in this seat with a harness and raised you up in front of this mammoth circular screen where they showed different aerial views of California.  There was an ocean fly-by, a golf course, complete with a ball just narrowly missing us, a hang glider, climbers, etc.  It all ended flying over Walt Disneyland in California during the fireworks.  Pretty cool ride, but Jenny probably wouldn't have liked it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now it was time to meet Grandpa and Grandma, so we headed over t our predesignated meeting spot, the pub in England.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Epcot Take III – Grandma, Grandpa, and Quin&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;Though details are sketchy on what Quin, Grandpa, and Grandma did for the 5 or so hours while we were separated, I do know they they had a good time doing what grandparents do with 6 week old (yes, he is 6 weeks old today!) grandchildren.  They walked from country to country, sometimes taking in a show or 360 degree movie, sometimes just watching people, sometimes getting a beer from Germany (they have good beer).  They seemed more relaxed than we did when we met up with them just before 4:00 in front of the pub in England.  Off Kilter was playing on the border of Canada and England again, as we started our combined adventure for the evening.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_WUSVNK-YI/AAAAAAAAAFk/cpIPf5uVEVs/s1600-h/Disney+235.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_WUSVNK-YI/AAAAAAAAAFk/cpIPf5uVEVs/s320/Disney+235.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5185213588637940098" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Epcot Take III – Combined Adventures&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After meeting in England, we grabbed a Bass from the pub and started walking the world.  If you've never been to EPCOT, the world showcase is a small representation of many different countries throughout the world.  Basically they have shopping, food, and maybe a ride at each of them.  They are put together very well, even though they are pretty much aimed at shopping.  We traveled the long way around which took us through France, Morocco, Japan, Italy, Germany (where we got more beer), Kenya, China, and finally Mexico where we were going to eat for the night.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_WUSVNK-ZI/AAAAAAAAAFs/0TviBriUi0I/s1600-h/Disney+244.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_WUSVNK-ZI/AAAAAAAAAFs/0TviBriUi0I/s320/Disney+244.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5185213588637940114" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Our dinner this evening was at the San Angeles Resaurante in Mexico, which was traditional Mexican food.  The food itself wasn't too bad if not a little too traditional for our tastes.  We could have used a few more tortillas and rice and beans.  The atmosphere was very cool, though.  It was set at dusk near the Aztec Pyramids.  Very cool.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We ended our stay at the park in a shop trying to find presents for all those that we hadn't bought for yet.  We got Jenny a shirt and Quin a stuffed Micky.  Finally we boarded the bus and went back to our rooms where we could make final arrangements for the trip home tomorrow.  On the way to the buses we spotted an apparently unused building.  We walked over by it and found people guarding the doors.  My dad asked what the buildings were, and was told that they were for conventions and meetings.  Just like Disney.  They have so many people that they can pay people to watch empty buildings!!!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nightcap&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the hotel for our last night, Ethan wanted to go swimming one last time.  He also wanted to show off his high flying acrobatics to Jenny, who I'm sure was quite as impressed as she sounded.  After depositing him back in the room, I walked the property to get some essentials that we just couldn't do without until the next night.  I was struck at how nice this resort actually was and immediately regretted not having more opportunity to spend time here.  There was a cheesy old guy band playing at the bar, kids were walking on the running path, a beach party was going on in the middle of the lake, it was a hopping place and looked very fun.  Next time we'll spend more time relaxing (yeah, right).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Knowing that we had to get up by 6:30 or earlier for our checkout and shuttle to the airport, we called it a night one last time in Walt Disney World.&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/4673522320009323155/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=4673522320009323155' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/4673522320009323155'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/4673522320009323155'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2008/03/disney-day-5.html' title='Disney Day 5'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_WUSFNK-WI/AAAAAAAAAFU/UbKlt_zXtg4/s72-c/Disney+220.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-8763619591758719949</id><published>2008-03-28T22:24:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2008-04-02T22:54:36.784-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Vacation'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Ethan'/><title type='text'>Disney Day 4</title><content type='html'>&lt;span style="font-size:130%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Late Start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quin was up during the night and we were getting tired, so we slept in a little bit this morning.  Jenny and I got out for a run around the 1.4 mile running path that goes around the resort (we went twice around), we gave the kids baths, then we grabbed a leisurely breakfast at the Shutters food court at our resort.  It was a good jumping off point for the rest of the day, which we planned on spending at Animal Kingdom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_RUt1NK-VI/AAAAAAAAAFM/_lL8ZaqopMk/s1600-h/Disney+200.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_RUt1NK-VI/AAAAAAAAAFM/_lL8ZaqopMk/s320/Disney+200.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5184862217363454290" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Animal Kingdom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's Animal Kingdom is their newest theme park.  Mom and dad had been at the park once before, right after it opened in 2001 when they chaperoned my Brother Brett's high school choir trip to Disney world.  Our expectations were low as my dad said the park wasn't very big and there wasn't much to do at it.  Apparently they have done some building since then, because we had a full day of fun and excitement at this park.&lt;/p&gt; Our first inclination was to Fast Pass everything, so my dad and I sprinted towards the rides we wanted to go on while Jenny, mom, and Ethan tended to Quin, who was ready to eat already when we got there.  We first Fast Passed the Jungle Safari, then went and tried to do the same to Kali Rapids.  There, however, we were met with an invalid ticket.  The woman behind the kiosks explained that we could only Fast Pass once within a period of time, and that period of time changed depending on park conditions.  Another Fast Pass was not available to me for 2 hours, for example.  I noticed later in the day after Fast Passing another ride that the wait was only 35 minutes, so the length of time must have something to do with the number of people using them or in the park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We went back to gather the family and headed to the Tree of Life, the centerpiece of the Animal Kingdom.  Underneath the tree was &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;It's Tough Being a Bug&lt;/span&gt;, a 3-d interactive movie about bugs.  It was pretty good, and a little scary.  At one point they called an attack on the audience and some bees stung us from behind our chairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_RUt1NK-TI/AAAAAAAAAE8/ngSrHIenJtk/s1600-h/Disney+180.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_RUt1NK-TI/AAAAAAAAAE8/ngSrHIenJtk/s320/Disney+180.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5184862217363454258" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;After our bug adventure, it was time already to go on our safari.  First, dad and I traveled to the Dinosaur area to Fast Pass Dinosaur.  On the way back, we were waylaid by two people who wanted to talk about Quin, "how old is he," "boy is he adorable," same old stuff.  We got a lot of attention during this trip.  Anyway, back to the safari.  It was awesome, many of our party's favorite attraction of the trip.  It took us on a rugged Jeep-like vehicle through the animal reserve where Disney keeps an entire savanah of African animals, elephants, giraffes, zebras, ostrichs, there were a lot of animals.  At one point our truck got stopped briefly while an ostrich decided to stand in the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to Dinosaur, we had heard from one of Ethan's teachers that he would love this ride.  Well, we'll never know because he wouldn't go on it.  No amount of bribery was getting him on this ride, for some reason.  Well, after Jenny, dad, and I actually went on the ride, it turns out he was probably right, he would have been very scared.  It was a pretty neat ride, on a roller-coaster like vehicle called a "time machine" that took us back to the Cretaceous period.  There were dinosaurs all over the place and the sky was starting to fall (the asteroid was about to hit).  Yeah, Ethan would have probably wet himself on this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_RUt1NK-UI/AAAAAAAAAFE/lSiJHgWajoM/s1600-h/Disney+186.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_RUt1NK-UI/AAAAAAAAAFE/lSiJHgWajoM/s320/Disney+186.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5184862217363454274" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;For a change of pace, and to get off our feet, we went to the Birds of Prey show, which was basically a bunch of birds flying in and out of scene.  It was OK, nothing to write home about.  Before we went to that, though, we Fast Passed Primeval Whirl, a twister-like roller coaster that Ethan actually wanted to go on.  He wasn't scared at all to go on it, so Jenny and I went on it with him.  I can't believe this was the same kid, because he just loved this ride.  Jenny and I, not so much.  We don't really like spinning rides.  On the way off the ride Ethan noticed a pile of vomit along the boardwalk returning us to the earth.  He thought that was pretty cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, we had finally timed it just right to see a Disney parade.  Ethan and Jenny had decent seats, though they were looking right into the sun.  Apparently it was a pretty good parade.  I stayed back with Quin and got to glimpse some old guy that was so tired that he sat in the rented stroller for what I assume was his grandchild.  We also struck up a conversation with a woman that I can only describe as a "Disney Freak."  She told us all about this Pirates and Princesses breakfast that we should have sent Ethan to.  They get to dress up and eat breakfast with a character, oh and it costs like $250.  Sorry, not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had to burn a little more time before dinner in Africa, so we caught the Lion King circus show, which was excellent.  There were acrobats dressed up like Monkeys and suspended rope artists dressed up like birds.  We passed the rest of the time taking a walking tour of the animal reserve that we had previously driven through earlier in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At last, we went to the Tusker House, a restaurant in the Africa area of the park.  This was a buffet with African flavored foods, and I think most of us agreed that it was the best food we had the entire trip.  Cous-cous, curry chicken, breads, it was all good.  Of course, we were very hungry, so that might have had something to do with it.  While there we had beer called Tusker Beer, a Kenyan beer that wasn't too bad.  I may have to look it up and get some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We left the park a little early by Disney standards, around 7:30.  This park closes earlier than the others, I assume because of the animals.  It was all fine and good, though, because Jenny and I had plans for the evening.  On the bus we met a family from Hartland that had tried to get to Disney on the Friday before Easter.  If you live in the Milwaukee area, you know that as the Friday of 14 inches of spring snow!  Needless to say, they weren't able to fly that day.  The worst part was that AirTran didn't have another flight schedule to Orlando until the following Tuesday, so they decided to drive down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Downtown Disney&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After getting Ethan and Quin ready for bed, we left the kids with grandma and grandpa and caught a bus to Downtown Disney, another new attraction since the last time I was here.  This area is just like the rest of the parks without the rides.  In other words, there were restaurants and shops, and still lots of people.  We found a couple of trinkets and souvenirs to buy, but quickly ended up at an Irish pub near Pleasure Island.  After a beer each and half of our second, the bartender came over to us and asked, "Mickey Mouse kicking your ass?  You have that look about you."  He couldn't have been more right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downtown Disney was all fine and good.  The best part was just to be able to sit upright and have adult conversation for a little while.  The beer was good, too.  We were both struck by how many kids were still out at this time of night which was hovering around 10:00-10:30.  At any rate, we caught a bus and were back home before 11:30 so we could prepare for our last day at the parks.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/8763619591758719949/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=8763619591758719949' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/8763619591758719949'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/8763619591758719949'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2008/03/disney-day-4.html' title='Disney Day 4'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_RUt1NK-VI/AAAAAAAAAFM/_lL8ZaqopMk/s72-c/Disney+200.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-2852871540687253945</id><published>2008-03-27T21:02:00.005-05:00</published><updated>2008-04-01T21:46:54.521-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Vacation'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Ethan'/><title type='text'>Disney Day 3</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_LqYVNK-QI/AAAAAAAAAEk/Pok-0lG43m8/s1600-h/Disney-0.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_LqYVNK-QI/AAAAAAAAAEk/Pok-0lG43m8/s320/Disney-0.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5184463824787011842" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Magic Kingdom Part II&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today we decided to try something a little different.  Rather than sleeping in and dealing with the crowds of people, we thought we'd leave a little early in hopes of getting on some more rides in less confined areas.  So we took off early for the bus (OK, I think we still got on the bus around 9:00) and headed for the Magic Kingdom.  If you've never been to Disney, the Magic Kingdom is one of those parks that you can spend days and days in, so our two half days really didn't do it justice, but it would have to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We arrived just after the park opened and everything was as we hoped, there weren't &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;that&lt;/span&gt; many people there, but there were still a lot of them.  We caught the end of the castle dance review before heading over to Adventureland where we would find &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Pirates of the Caribbean&lt;/span&gt;.  On the way we got stuck at the Swiss Family Robinson area, which looked kind of lame, so I took the park passes and went to Fast Pass some other rides.  I caught the Jungle Cruise right away and continued down to Pirates, but it did not accept fast passes.  Oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After pulling Jenny and Ethan off of the treehouse, and gathering mom, dad, and Quin, who had found another family to talk to, we went to &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;Pirates&lt;/span&gt; which didn't have much of a wait at all to get on it.  It wasn't a bad ride, another one of those that were designed much in the same vein as &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;It's a Small World&lt;/span&gt; in that it was a boat and we went through a bunch of rooms with characters in it.  You can tell this ride is somewhat old, though, as it was pirate themed, and the pirates were doing what pirates do best, namely drinking and harassing women.  Not sure how this ride would go through the committees that oversee this type of thing now-a-days.  They also added Captain Jack and Davey Jones to the experience, which was kind of neat.  It was strange how the movie was based on the ride to begin with, then the ride was re-inspired by what they did with the movie...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After getting off of Pirates, our Fast Passes came due for the Jungle Cruise, which is a pretty neat ride only in so much as the dialog is really enjoyable.  This ride is, again, in the same vein as &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;It's a Small World&lt;/span&gt; again in that we got on a boat and looked at stuff, but it differed in that there was a live person on the ride giving us a &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;tour&lt;/span&gt; and it was outside.  The woman giving the tour was delivering the canned tour dialog very well.  Some of the bits I can remember include, "OK, everybody listen very carefully, I have some very complicated boarding instructions, wait, wait, wait, OK, get in," and "Perhaps at the end of this ride you will find their buried treasure.  Oh wait, this is Disneyworld, you are probably going to find a gift shop."  Overall, it was a very old, crusty ride, that was made fun by the dialog they had put together for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Jungle Cruise, Ethan wanted to go on a fair-like ride calld Alladin's Magic Carpet ride, so I took the opportunity to Fast Pass another ride, this time in Tomorrowland.  When I returned, I gathered the family and we decided it was time for some lunch.  Lunch was taken in Frontierland (I'm not entirely sure on the names of these areas, so please, if you are a Disney purest, forgive me) at Pecos Bill Tall Tale Cafe.  This was one of our quick service meals and was not bad at all.  Burgers, wraps, whatever.  I think Ethan actually got to eat something other than chicken nuggets and macaroni and cheese for once at this restaurant.  As an aside, I was shocked at how limited the children's choices were for food at Disney.  You would think that they would cater (so to speak) specifically to kids when offering food choices, but most of the places only had chicken nuggets and macaroni and cheese.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having nourished ourselves, we left Frontierland and crossed back over to Tomorrowland where we rode on one of the most enjoyable rides we rode during our entire stay, Buzz Lightyear's Spin Attack.  This ride was basically a moving shooting gallery.  You get in this pod thing on rails that took you through an area setup with a bunch of Zurg things with targets on them.  There were two guns mounted on the pod and a steering wheel.  Ethan and I manned the guns while Jenny steered.  As you were going it kept score.  I scored 33000 points, which I thought was awesome until I saw the point breakdown at the end.  They had a category for over 1,000,000 points!  I guess I suck worse than I thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We departed the Magic Kingdom at last after getting a picture with Buzz Lightyear himself and touring Tomorrowland on the Tomorrowland Transit Authority.  The parade had just finished up along mainstreet, we had missed it again.  I was intrigued to see they had people out with vacuum cleaners to clean up the confetti and leaves that had littered the streets.  I guess I hadn't noticed it before, but the Magic Kingdom is freakishly clean.  I guess now I know why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;font-size:130%;" &gt;Break Time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having experienced very long days the two days prior, we decided this time to take a couple of hours to relax at the resort.  So we departed from the Magic Kingdom and did just that.  Of course Ethan doesn't really know yet how to relax, so he and I had to go to the pool and play "leech," a game where Ethan clings to my neck and won't let go and I have to try to get him off of me.  It was hard.  We did get to see a bunch of cheerleaders acting like cheerleaders in the pool which was mildly amusing.  They were doing a bunch of throws and pyramids and stuff in the pool.  Again, mildly amusing.  My mom came out for a little while to swim with us.  She never really learned how to swim, but she barely gets wet due to her huge amount of buoyancy.  Ethan, being a know-it-all, started to tell my mom how to swim.  Actually, he was doing a pretty good job of explaining it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_LqYlNK-SI/AAAAAAAAAE0/WaD5FWwAVnU/s1600-h/Disney-2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_LqYlNK-SI/AAAAAAAAAE0/WaD5FWwAVnU/s320/Disney-2.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5184463829081979170" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;EPCOT Part II&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our master plan for the day had us going back to EPCOT for an afternoon of rides followed by dinner in China.  On the bus on the way, we ran into the coach of the Germantown softball team who was down there with his team competing in some Disney softball thing.  It was funny how many people we had met from Wisconsin, but this guy even knew a guy that I officiate with, which made it even stranger.  Also on the bus we ran into a family who had a 9 month old boy that looked just like Quin, or rather, Quin looked just like him.  He was a very smiley thing and was grabbing the hair on my arms and stuff.  It was pretty fun to see what we have to look forward to with Quin in the coming months.  They really grow quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we finally got into the park after bag inspections and ticket scanning, my parents decided they would like to go on Spaceship Earth.  Knowing Ethan's track records with getting on rides, we decided to go off on our own and allow them to partake so we went over to the Nemo Adventure in The Sea.  The ride itself was a bit lame, and broke halfway through, but at the end they had some pretty neat aquarium animals on display including two manitees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We ended our afternoon at EPCOT at the other half of Innoventions.  Jenny and Ethan were exploring the wonderful world of garbage at the Waste Management area while Quin and I tried to find Grandpa and Grandma.  After we had all met up again, we finally headed over to China where our reservation awaited at the Nine Dragons Restaurant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a small miracle to get us into this restaurant.  My dad had to go up to the podium and bust some heads after several walk-ins were admitted before we were, and we had a reservation.  Apparently they had called our name and some other family walked in and took our table.  Not to worry, we were seated right by the window, which gave us good seats to watch the fireworks later, which turned out to be the only time we got to see the fireworks during our stay.  The food was excellent.  Even Ethan ate Chinese food for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_LqYVNK-RI/AAAAAAAAAEs/GaIsatYT1Ok/s1600-h/Disney-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_LqYVNK-RI/AAAAAAAAAEs/GaIsatYT1Ok/s320/Disney-1.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5184463824787011858" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;After dinner, we browsed the shops where Ethan bought some rare earth magnets and I bought a flower stick, some juggling sticks that look like fun.  It was getting late at this point (9:30), so we decided to start heading back to the bus area.  Along the way, we somehow convinced Ethan to go on a Viking cruise, another boat ride through a building with stuff in it (it's a small world after all...).  We departed from Norway at almost 10:00, the park was closing...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had almost gotten out of the park when my parents convinced Jenny and I that we should go on Spaceship Earth since it was such a neat ride.  They didn't think Ethan would like it that much, so Jenny and I got in line.  The line wasn't very long, but it turned out that only resort guests were being admitted, and then only with a wrist band.  So out of the line quickly to find the wristbands, then back in and we were admitted almost immediately.  This ride was on a time machine which the two of us sat in.  At the beginning they asked a bunch of questions which you inputted the answers on the touch screen in your time machine, and they took your picture.  The ride then started with Judy Dench giving a verbal history of human progress, mostly concentrating on communication.  There were some very interesting things that I did now know, like the Phoenicians invented the alphabet that we use today because they traded with so many different cultures, they wanted to have an alphabet that was compatible with all of them.  Another thing they asserted was that the personal computer was invented in a garage in California, basically saying that Jobs and Wozniak invented the PC.  I'm not entirely sure that is true, but it was interesting anyway.  At the end, you are treated to a view of the inside of the ball which is completely lighted up with stars in a night sky, very breathtaking.  Also, as we rode back to the "present," they showed us a presentation with our pictures of how our future would look.  It was neat technology, but the funniest part was Jenny's picture.  The algorithm they had to remove the background from the picture apparently thought her eye was part of the background and blacked it out, which made her look like a pirate.  We laughed...  Guess you had to be there...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_LqYlNK-SI/AAAAAAAAAE0/WaD5FWwAVnU/s1600-h/Disney-2.jpg"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/2852871540687253945/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=2852871540687253945' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/2852871540687253945'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/2852871540687253945'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2008/03/disney-day-3.html' title='Disney Day 3'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_LqYVNK-QI/AAAAAAAAAEk/Pok-0lG43m8/s72-c/Disney-0.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-7321004317158772367</id><published>2008-03-26T22:01:00.002-05:00</published><updated>2008-04-01T07:14:43.826-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Vacation'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Ethan'/><title type='text'>Disney Day 2</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_Gl51NK-MI/AAAAAAAAAEE/ew70iD9dw4A/s1600-h/Disney-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_Gl51NK-MI/AAAAAAAAAEE/ew70iD9dw4A/s320/Disney-1.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5184107059033602242" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Good Night's Sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our first night in the hotel was blissfully uneventful.  My biggest worry coming to this resort with an infant was that he would be up and unconsolable in the night and he would wake people up.  Turns out I had nothing to worry about all along.  In fact, I would say that Quin probably slept better at the hotel than he does at home.  That is most likely because we were so close by and it was easy to get up to tend to him.  Either way, it worked out well and I had nothing to complain about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethan slept in Grandpa and Grandma's room the first night, as we thought he might be kept awake by Quin more than by Grandma's snoring.  Nothing really stirred him, though, and he slept quite well through the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the morning, Jenny and I got up somewhat more rested than the day before.  We slept in until around 8:30 having only gotten up once each with Quin during the night, so we felt good enough to try out the 1.4 mile track that surrounds the lake in the middle of the grounds.  The Caribbean Beach Resort is a number of buildings organized into Islands.  Ours was Martinique.  Each of the islands surrounds a big lake in the middle with beaches surrounding it.  Each island also had its own pool, which we took advantage of several times.  Anyway, Jenny and I went for a small run then stopped by the central shop to get water for Quin's bottles and some snacks for breakfast.  After that, off to the parks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_Gl-lNK-NI/AAAAAAAAAEM/hBykfWlg56U/s1600-h/Disney-0.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_Gl-lNK-NI/AAAAAAAAAEM/hBykfWlg56U/s320/Disney-0.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5184107140637980882" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;EPCOT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our first stop for this day was EPCOT, which again stands for Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow.  We grabbed a quick snack for breakfast as we had reservations in EPCOT for a character lunch, then jumped on the bus to EPCOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have I mentioned how big the Disney World Resort is?  Let me put it another way in case I haven't properly explained that yet.  From our hotel, we could see Spaceship Earth, the big ball in the center of EPCOT.  It seemed not at all far away.  However, after boarding the bus in the morning, it took us no less than 20 minutes to get to the park!  Now, after having consulted a map, I now know that it took a long time to get there because the park entrance was all the way around the park, forcing us to weave in and out of several highways to get there, but still, 20 minutes, and they are both on the same property!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EPCOT, much like the Magic Kingdom before it, was BUSY!  There were people walking all over the place.  The weather was somewhat better than yesterday, but still not hot, which was OK since there were so many people around, hot weather would have made things uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first look at EPCOT is no less amazing than that of the Magic Kingdom.  The huge Spaceship Earth structure dominating the sky right at the entrance, with the Beach Boys music playing (why the Beach Boys, I couldn't say), water fountains splashing about everywhere...  They definitely went the extra mile with this park to make it seem different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EPCOT is separated into two separate parts, Futureworld where there are a bunch of rides and attractions that deal with imagination, conservation, and life in the future, and the World Showcase, which has buildings and attractions attempting to capture the feel of different countries around the world.  Since it was quite busy, we decided to check out the newest attraction first, Soarin', which was located in "The Land," one of the buildings in Futureworld.  Well, that line was already around 2 hours long, so we did the next best thing, we caught a couple of shows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first show we saw was called "Live With the Land," which was narrated by Pumba, Timone, and Simba from the Lion King.  This, along with most attractions, seemed to have the actual actors doing the voice work for the video, which is impressive.  The show was pretty neat.  It was all about how we should conserve and live with the land instead of against it.  I found it somewhat ironic that Disney of all companies was preaching conservation when they pump millions of gallons of water through their fountains and use tons of plastic to deliver food to their hungry customers each day, but hey, the message is still important, and the show wasn't too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next attraction we took in was again in The Land.  This time we boarded a boat (a common theme in many Disney attractions) and toured through some labs that Disney had setup in an attempt to grow things in different ways.  This trip was pretty cool as it showed all kinds of different plants being grown in a huge greenhouse.  They also tried new ways of growing things, like suspending tomato plants in the air so that the air can get to the leaves properly, or growing tomatoes upside-down.  Fairly interesting stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had made reservations for a character lunch in The Land's table service restaurant for around 2:00, but after taking in our two shows we still had some time to burn, so we headed outside and went into a building titled "Imagineering."  This was basically a big hands-on playground of all sorts of technology that could change the future, stimulate the imagination, or educate in some other way.  They had stations setup with video games, fire alarms, a pizza game, but most impressive, a Segway area.  Mom, Dad, and I waited in line for what turned out to be one of the most fun adult rides in the park.  No kids allowed on these!  We first sat through a 10 minute orientation video, then we got to go out into the larger area and drive one, and I have to say, it is a lot of fun!  I want to buy one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_ImvVNK-OI/AAAAAAAAAEU/vpzBXcl-VEU/s1600-h/Disney-2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_ImvVNK-OI/AAAAAAAAAEU/vpzBXcl-VEU/s320/Disney-2.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5184248715644958946" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;After peeling Ethan away from the video games, we worked our way over to the Harvest Cafe for our character lunch.  I really didn't think much of a character lunch when we got there, and actually had no intention of scheduling one thinking Ethan was too old for them.  Boy was I wrong.  The food wasn't too bad, but Ethan really liked the characters.  Any time one of them came around, his eyes got really big and he shouted to one of us to look at them.  He was particularly excited about Pluto, though why, I can't quite figure out since he didn't even know who he was.  The characters we ended up getting to meet were Chip, Dale, Pluto, and Mickey.  Dale stopped by for an especially long time having developed somewhat of an obsession with Quin.  That was a little creepy, but we moved on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After lunch, we left Futureworld and decided to try to get to Disney's Hollywood Studios.  We had read earlier that we could take a boat there, which meant we didn't have to take a bus, so that sounded good to us.  To get to the boat, we had to go through part of the World Showcase, Canada and England to be specific.  Canada wasn't that spectacular to just walk by, but they did have a band present called Off Kilter which was a rock band with a bagpipe player as one of the main instruments.  It was quite interesting.  England was more interesting to walk through, but still, we had a mission and intended to accomplish it.  So we went through the park exit and boarded Friendship 3, a boat that serviced some of the EPCOT resorts and ultimately Disney's Hollywood Studios.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The boat ride was actually a blast.  Everything at this park is an experience, I have to tell you.  It was commanded by two old guys who clearly didn't need to be working any more, but probably did because they liked people and they got to drive a boat around all day.  They had fun talking with the people on the boat and driving it around all day, so it made for a pleasant ride.  Along the way we stopped at several EPCOT resorts which looked quite nice.  In fact, if we weren't there with kids (although, what would be the point of that?), I think one of these resorts would be ideal since it was very close to other things to do, like a brewery, the ESPN Club, and dancing places.  With kids, though, our resort was very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Disney's Hollywood Studios&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disney's Hollywood Studios, formerly Disney's MGM Studios, is a smaller park, and had fewer people in it, which was nice!  The layout was pretty neat as well.  After entering, you are placed on a street that looks much like the entrance to the Magic Kingdom, but with a Hollywood feel.  Like Magic Kingdom and EPCOT, the park is split into zones, but these zones are different movie themes.  One area was a full scale replica of a street in New York City!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_Im7FNK-PI/AAAAAAAAAEc/qBf7tXuBzeg/s1600-h/Disney-3.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_Im7FNK-PI/AAAAAAAAAEc/qBf7tXuBzeg/s320/Disney-3.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5184248917508421874" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The first show we saw was the Indiana Jones stunt spectacular.  This show took place in an outdoor theater with a huge set piece at the front that looked like the cave from the opening sequence to the first Indiana Jones movie.  Before the show, some casting member came out and got volunteers to do silly things in front of the audience, which was cute.  Once the show started, though, was when the real fun began.  The first stunt had them doing a rendition of the opening sequence from Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Ethan has never seen that movie, and he was hooked.  The even did the ball rolling towards Indy, and him getting squished, which I think they added for this show.  After that stunt, the entire stage moved aside on huge tires and revealed a middle-easter scene in the background where they staged another stunt.  All in all, they did three different big-set stunts.  Ethan's favorite part was whent hey fake punched each other, so don't be surprised if he asks you to let him pretend to punch you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Indiana Jones, my dad and I went on Star Tours, a ride themed after Star Wars where you ride in a transport shuttle through some space battles and other things.  For me it was the first ride where I stood in line and didn't have the benefit of Fast Pass, and I didn't like waiting very much!  Jenny, Ethan, Quin, and Grandma went to the Muppet show 3-d movie, which I heard was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After meeting up with them, we took in some miscellaneous other rides, some of which we had to skip because Ethan developed a fear of dark places that he could not overcome on this day.  Ultimately we ended up at Hollywood and Vine, our second table service meal for the day.  This restaurant is a buffet and serves American style food.  It wasn't too bad, probably the most ordinary of all of our table service meals, but they did have a decent beer selection, so that made me happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Wore Out Part II&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a full day of park hopping, we were pretty wore out yet again.  We decided to forgo the light show, which looked pretty cool, and head back to the hotel so we could live to play another day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:130%;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Things we Learned Today about Disney&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do a character lunch even if you think your kids won't like it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Disney's Hollywood Studios is a smaller park, but attracts fewer people.

The dates will be posted as though they occurred on the days in which the events actually occurred, however they will not be written or posted on those actual days.  Please adjust your expectations accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overview&lt;/span&gt; &lt;p&gt;Mom and dad (Glen and Cheryl) decided that it was time for some reciprocity and treated my family to a trip to Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida.  When I say reciprocity, I'm of course referring to the numerous vacations that I was unable to attend with the family since I was too old when they went.  Sure, we went to exciting places like Philadelphia (in a car), California (in a car), and Colorado (in a car), but my younger brothers benefited from my having finished college on time by getting to go to places like Hawaii, Dominican Republic, and Peru – and none of those were by car!  Anyway, it was a very nice gesture on their part, and Ethan is at a very good age to take advantage of their generosity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We planned the trip several months ago.  Knowing that we were in the middle of the adoption process, we purchased insurance for our trip, thinking that we might have to forego the trip if an adoption came through.  As luck would have it, an adoption did happen, but we didn't have to forego the trip and Quin was able to come as well.  You may think we're crazy taking a 5 week old infant along on a trip like this, but our rationale was that he is really at a very good age to do this.  He can't move yet, so he can't get into anything, and he's still pretty light, so carrying him around shouldn't be too hard.  We'll see how it goes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h2 class="western"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;The Trip Out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The day started out very early today.  Last night was a rush to get to sleep while hoping Quin would cooperate.  For the most part he did.  He slept really well all night, waking up twice to eat quickly then go right back to sleep.  Still, we had to get up before 5:00 AM to get ready.  We had packed the car the evening before, and Jenny had all the bags ready to go for the morning, so we were out of the house by 5:45, our desired departure time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Traffic was light at that time in the morning, which was good.  Of course, the parking structure was completely full except for exposed parking on the 6th floor.  The exposure was a little rough to take since spring in Wisconsin just means it's just as cold but with more wind.  Still, we were to the airport by 6:30.  Checkin was smooth, we grabbed a bite to eat, then headed over to the security check to have our body cavity searches.  One thing we found out early at the security line was that traveling with a 5 week old infant gets you a lot of attention.  One of the gate agents started ogling immediately and then called one of the other agents over to ogle as well.  Needless to say, we didn't have too many issues getting through security.  It seemed like they shut down an entire security line just for us, which we pretty much needed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the gate, we met a young lady who was traveling with her grandmother that didn't know where she was going.  Her mom had purchased her a trip to Disney but didn't tell her about it.  We didn't get to see her when she got there, but I can imagine it would have been something to behold.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While waiting for the plane, my mom explained to Ethan that he would have to chew gum or something so that his ears would pop on the takeoff.  This scared him, so as we were boarding he was telling us about how nervous he was that he was going to hurt his ears.  Nice one, mom.  When we got onto the plane, Ethan made sure he had a piece of gum in his mouth and another one nearby in case he lost that one.  Once we took off, though, he was having a great time in the air.  He loved flying!  Jenny, on the other hand, didn't fare quite as well.  She doesn't really like flying.  Quin did great.  He slept the whole way with no issue.  The flight was uneventful.  Everything went about as you would expect it would with a 6 year old.  I tried to listen to my MP3 player, but I only got through 1 song through the entire flight.  Also, I tried to read a magazine, but only got through 1 article.  Ethan was very curious and wanted to talk about a lot of stuff during the whole flight!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As an editorial aside, Jenny was very nervous about flying AirTran Airlines for some reason, but once the flight was completed, she was pleasantly surprised.  The service was exceptional, the airplane was clean and as roomy as airplanes can be these days, and the flight left and arrived on time.  Nice work, Airtran.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Upon our arrival in Orlando, we headed towards the Disney Magical Express on the ground transportation floor.  My parents had purchased this option which allows us to skip baggage claim and go directly to our resort.  This was awesome.  Basically all we had to do was take our carry on bags onto a charter bus and ride to the park.  It was a brief 20 minute ride during which time we were treated to an orientation video that told us all about our life at the resort.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="western"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_BfiFNK-GI/AAAAAAAAADU/NMjAF7VUuM4/s1600-h/disney001.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="cursor: pointer;" align="right" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_BfiFNK-GI/AAAAAAAAADU/NMjAF7VUuM4/s320/disney001.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5183748210221054050" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;The Resort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;After our brief bus ride, we arrived at the “Caribbean Beach” resort located across the street from Epcot (which turns out to be probably a mile or two away, I'll let you know when I actually find it).  The resort is nothing spectacular, but nice.  Our room was decent size.  Enough with the hotel room, though, we wanted to eat something and to check out the facilities.  It was 1:00 local time at this point, and we had been up since 4:45 (5:45 local), so we were getting hungry.  Luckily, my parents had splurged and purchased the dining package, which entitles us to 1 table service, 1 quick service, and 1 snack per day each.  We went to the central area of our hotel complex (which is somewhere in the area of 2200 rooms) and found the food court.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The food court counted as a Quick Service meal for the day, but we were to find out that you get way too much food at this meal to eat in one sitting.  If you are going to be visiting Disney, I would recommend this option.  I don't remember the cost, but each of our meals would have cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $13 if we would have purchased them individually.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After lunch, we explored the resort a little bit.  It is huge!  I mentioned before, it has somewhere in the neighborhood of 2200 rooms.  It is called the Caribbean Beach Resort, so there are something like 6 different building groupings, each named after a Caribbean island.  Our area is Martinique.  There are also areas for Bahamas, Aruba, Jamaica, among others.  In the middle of all of these buildings is a medium size lake with beaches surrounding it.  In each area is a heated swimming pool and in the center is a showcase swimming pool.  Unfortunately the showcase pool is closed at this time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 style="text-align: left;" class="western"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_BfiVNK-HI/AAAAAAAAADc/W0-r93rYPHg/s1600-h/disney002.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="cursor: pointer;" align="right" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_BfiVNK-HI/AAAAAAAAADc/W0-r93rYPHg/s320/disney002.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5183748214516021362" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;Swimming&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;After our explorations, our luggage still had not arrived in our room – oh, I forgot to mention that we didn't have to carry our luggage to our rooms.  Instead it was delivered to our room cruise style.  Very nice.  Anyway, our luggage had not yet arrived, so we decided to make do with what we had packed in our carry on luggage and went swimming.  It was a little chilly out, in the low 60s, but the pool was heated to 85 degrees, so Ethan and I had a blast.  He is really starting to swim well.  He had no trouble swimming all over the pool, including the deep areas.  When he and I were in the pool together, he swam underwater with me, raced me, and rough-housed with me for the better part of 90 minutes.  I tired out early and left the pool to have a beer with my parents and Jenny on the deck while Ethan continued to play for another 20 minutes.  We were finally able to coax him out of the pool with promises of visiting the park...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="western"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;Reservations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before we left for the park, we had read that it was a good idea to get reservations for any table service meals you planned on taking.  Since we had used our quick service meal for the day already, we set out to find a table service dinner.  I called the reservations number but was met with completely booked restaurants pretty much throughout the resort.  There was literally nothing available in any of the resorts we checked!  This was going to be difficult.  Taking this as a hint, we decided to make our reservations for the rest of the week at this time so we would at least be able to use our table service vouchers this week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Free tip to those that might be traveling to Disney in the near future.  If you are getting the dinner plan, call a week or two ahead of time and make your dinner reservations.  Otherwise you may be stuck without dinner one night...  We ultimately decided to use another of our quick service vouchers and make a reservation for table service later in the week for earlier in the day, so it all worked out in the end.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="western"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_BfilNK-II/AAAAAAAAADk/PHLbYR94h_8/s1600-h/disney003.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="cursor: pointer;" align="right" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_BfilNK-II/AAAAAAAAADk/PHLbYR94h_8/s320/disney003.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5183748218810988674" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;The Magic Kingdom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;After our complicated reservation process, and our luggage having arrived, we packed up and headed out to the Magic Kingdom, Disney's first resort on this property.  It would seem logical to walk there since we were staying on the Disney property itself, but it turns out we are like 5 miles away from the Magic Kingdom.  Everything is huge on this resort!  So, to get there, we boarded a bus and took a 15 minute drive to the park.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can't say it enough, this place is huge!  I had visited Disney when I was younger, and I don't remember it being this big!  To get to the park, you can take a bus, the monorail, or a boat!  They have big lakes where you can boat across from the parking lot and resorts to get to the park itself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When we finally got to the park, we scanned our passes and gave a print of our fingers (to stop pass-backs) and arrived at the Magic Kingdom.  If you've never been to Disney before, the first impression of the Magic Kingdom is impressive.  You are placed in the midst of a thriving downtown.  A cobblestone street travels down the middle of many shops and food stands, and there were people everywhere!!!  We found a statue of Walt where we took a picture, and we saw a bunch of people with balloons (LOTS of balloons), but there was nothing quite like the look on Ethan's face when he first saw Cinderella's Castle.  He was completely amazed and his jaw pretty much just dropped.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After getting over the initial shock of Cinderella's Castle, we headed over to the “It's a Small World” attraction, a staple for any first time Disney visitor.  The line wasn't terrible, about 25 minutes, and Ethan really seemed to like the ride.  I remembered it from my last visit, and it didn't seem that much better from that time, but hey, it's for the kids.  At one time during the ride, I looked up (because it wasn't very interesting looking at the attraction), and I saw ceiling tiles at the top of the building.  They were painted a dark color, some had sprinklers in them, some had things coming through them for the attraction.  In fact, it was those that caught my attention, because they manner in which they broke these tiles to get the pieces through was sort of funny.  It looked like they just broke it with their hands and stuck the things through.  This is kind of funny because everything else in the park is so well thought out and perfectly done.  At this point we passed a staircase covered in old carpeting with an illuminated exit sign over them.  Seeing that combined with the sprinklers on the ceiling made me think of how funny it would be if the ride burned down.  It would look just like that scene from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.  The little small world people smiling and dancing while they melted down, their voices distorting while the blaze envelops them.  I think I would like to see that...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Prior to getting on It's a Small World, we scanned our cards at Mickey's PhilharMagic show's Fast Pass station.  Scanning this allows you to skip ahead in line if you agree to just come back later.  Our scan allowed us to skip ahead if we came back between 6:30 and 7:30, which worked out well.  The show itself was a pretty neat production of many different Disney shows from the past 25 years all made into a 3-d show with smell-o-vision and water effects.  If you've been to the SpongeBob 4-d adventure at Noah's Ark, it's pretty much the same thing, but with Disney characters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At last, Ethan told us he wanted to go to the Buzz Lightyear ride, so we walked over to Tomorrowland and scanned our cards at the Fast Pass station.  While we waited, we decided to go to Stitch's Great Escape which only had a 10 minute wait.  I was unable to go on the ride since I was carrying Quin (using a Snugli infant carrier, which worked very well), but Ethan, Jenny, mom, and dad all went on it.  I was concerned since the brochure said it could scare young children.  I'm sure they meant three year olds, but I had a feeling it might be a problem for Ethan as well.  Sure enough, Jenny informed me that they had somewhat of an episode getting Ethan to actually go into the ride when it finally got down to it.  It was another one in the same vein as the PhilharMagic ride, but in smaller vessels.  He did end up going on the ride, but it wasn't without its drama.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We decided to grab one more quick service meal, since we were unable to obtain reservations for a table service meal, before we tried to go on the Buzz Lightyear ride.  After eating, though, we were all pretty beat, so we left the Magic Kingdom just minutes before the fireworks started and headed back to the resort.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="western"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;Winding Down&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;At this point, we are all pretty beat.  We're going to rest up and prepare for another big day tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 class="western"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:100%;"&gt;Interesting Tidbits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Epcot stands for Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_Bfi1NK-JI/AAAAAAAAADs/lRbFIx2jyTs/s1600-h/disney004.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="cursor: pointer;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_Bfi1NK-JI/AAAAAAAAADs/lRbFIx2jyTs/s320/disney004.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5183748223105955986" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/578343152956996555/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=578343152956996555' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/578343152956996555'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/578343152956996555'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2008/03/disney-day-1.html' title='Disney Day 1'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R_BfiFNK-GI/AAAAAAAAADU/NMjAF7VUuM4/s72-c/disney001.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-6242821185823312997</id><published>2008-03-19T13:55:00.003-05:00</published><updated>2008-03-19T14:00:33.817-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><title type='text'>This parenting thing is easy...</title><content type='html'>Jenny has to work today and tomorrow, so I'm working from home.  So I got my laptop out, put on some slippers, and got ready for some good ole fashioned parenting.  I tell you, it really isn't all that hard...&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R-FisVNK-FI/AAAAAAAAADM/_tdNjy0h50I/s320/QuinPics008-small.jpg" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/6242821185823312997/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=6242821185823312997' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/6242821185823312997'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/6242821185823312997'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2008/03/this-parenting-thing-is-easy.html' title='This parenting thing is easy...'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R-FisVNK-FI/AAAAAAAAADM/_tdNjy0h50I/s72-c/QuinPics008-small.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-4067846213509812393</id><published>2008-03-14T07:46:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2008-03-14T07:58:53.833-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Adoption'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Ethan'/><title type='text'>Pre Adoptive and a chink in the armor</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R9p2hOE88AI/AAAAAAAAADA/_sFiG--CP4I/s1600-h/IMG_3793.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px;

On Monday, both birth parents were given one last opportunity to choose to parent Quin.  The birth mother showed up and gave up her right to do so, and the birth father did not answer the attempts to contact him.  That's an important step for us!  That means that there shouldn't be an bad Lifetime movies written about our situation any time soon.  Now, we're still not the official parents of Quin, still only the foster parents.  The adoption agency is now the legal guardian of Quin and all major medical decisions and travel plans must now be arranged through them.  We will also have three home visits from the agency to make sure things are going well.  After Quin has been with us for 6 months, the agency will file for a court date in Waukesha to make the adoption official.  At that time we will get a birth certificate and have the ability to apply for a social security number.  As you can guess, we're very happy about this step.  It is a major one!  We feel very fortunate given all that could have happened.  Jenny was in contact with an adoptive family who had been selected only to have the birth parents change their minds just before the child was born.  I've also heard stories recently about people who were going through the legal risk period only to have the birth grandmother decide she was going to care for the child three days prior to the termination of parental rights hearing.  She went through the trouble of having her daughter declared unfit to parent so she became the legal guardian.  Needless to say, we feel very fortunate and blessed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quin himself is doing very well.  He eats pretty much every 3.5 to 4 hours.  He sleeps well at night...  Well, he still gets up every 4 hours to eat, but as soon as he's done eating it's back to sleep for him.  I've found the magic that is Netflix Watch Instantly to pass the late hours while Quin eats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethan is doing well, too.  He is a very good big brother, though he's shown some recent signs of weakness.  The other day, Jenny had to go out to the grocery store or something and Ethan wanted to play Spiderman: Friend or Foe, his favorite game on the Wii.  It's a game that he and I play together.  So he went downstairs and got the game setup while I situated Quin.  When I came down with Quin in a bouncy seat, he said, "Aww, don't bring &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;him&lt;/span&gt; down!"  I asked him why, to which he replied, "when he cries, we have to quite playing."  I can't blame him, infants are pretty inconvenient sometimes, and so far it's the only chink in the armor we've been able to detect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's it for now.  I'm sure exciting posts are coming up as Easter in Neillsville is right around the corner, then it's off to Orlando for a Disney vacation with Grandma and Grandpa Grady.  Exciting times ahead.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/4067846213509812393/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=4067846213509812393' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/4067846213509812393'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/4067846213509812393'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2008/03/pre-adoptive-and-chink-in-armor.html' title='Pre Adoptive and a chink in the armor'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R9p2hOE88AI/AAAAAAAAADA/_sFiG--CP4I/s72-c/IMG_3793.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-6039786972964159494</id><published>2008-03-03T22:00:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2008-03-03T22:17:13.155-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Lost Teeth'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Ethan'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Drawing'/><title type='text'>Loose teeth and doctor's visits</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R8zJpT97TNI/AAAAAAAAACw/61RYCJQsjyI/s1600-h/IMG_3748.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R8zJpT97TNI/AAAAAAAAACw/61RYCJQsjyI/s320/IMG_3748.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5173731783513689298" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Today, Quin is 16 days old.  Almost like his golden birthday in days!  Jenny had to go in to work today, so Quin and I worked from home, and let me tell you, he does better work than some of the interns I've had!  I fed him once at 7:00, then he didn't want to eat again until around noon (my mistake as I got lost in e-mails for awhile).  After that, he slept again until Jenny got him around 3:00, so like I said, he probably did more good (or less bad) than some of the interns I've had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the middle of all that, though, Quin had his 2 week checkup.  Everything looked great except for a little infection in one eye and potentially a little thrush.  He now weighs in at 8 pounds 4.5 ounces, which is up a full 1.5 pounds from his last visit 10 days ago!  He's also up to 21 inches long, up only .5 inches, but still, not too shabby.  He continues to be a very good baby for the most part and Jenny and I are adjusting fairly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other news, Ethan lost another tooth this past weekend.  Saturday night was pretty traumatic, however.  Jenny was helping him brush his teeth when, whammy!, one of his loose teeth got caught in the bristles and started bleeding all over the place.  There's something about your own blood when you are 6, apparently, that causes you to lose all capability for reason.  After much sobbing, we finally got him calmed down to talk through his options.  Option 1, let me pull the tooth.  Option 2, let Ethan pull the tooth.  Option 3, just go to bed.  Having regained his talent for reason, he wisely chose none of the options...  I wasn't sure what that meant, so I told him that I was going downstairs and that he could do whatever he wanted to (see, I still had my wits about me!).  About 5 minutes later he came down and said to us, "if I'm going to lose a tooth, I want to be with you guys."  Damn, he knows how to cut to my core!  Anyway, there were a lot of bribes and talk of bravery and whatnot, but in the end he finally just went to sleep to let nature take its course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning while getting ready for church, Ethan was brushing his own teeth when the tooth just fell out on its own.  Instantly he was going around talking about how brave he was and how he should be able to get a new toy, and how "that didn't hurt at all!"  At any rate, hopefully the next couple of teeth won't be so traumatic.  He has three other lose ones as we speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, below you fill find Ethan's latest masterpiece.  It is a recreation of Spider-man's duel with the New Goblin from Spiderman 3.  Of course, he hasn't seen the movie, but I think he captured it pretty well.  Notice the pumpkin bomb exploding near the tree.

Jenny took Quin up to meet his aunts in the Dells while celebrating their mom's birthday.  Since it was a rare beautiful day, Ethan and I decided to go skiing at our local "mountain."  Really it's a recovered garbage dump, I think...  It's definitely not a mountain, but it's close.  The last time Ethan skied was last year in the U.P. and he did really well.  Today was no different.  He hasn't forgotten much from his time in ski school.  The early going was a little rough.  He had some control problems and was a little timid of the rope tow.  But after two times down the hill, he was going up the rope himself and starting to be a bit of a daredevil.  He was doing a little more "french fries" and less "pizza" than I'm comfortable with.  We were there for two hours, each time Ethan would say, "one more time down," or "five more times down."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We finally left the hill and went to Burger King, a place Ethan has wanted to go to eat for two weeks.  There is a special toy in the happy meals that he really wanted.  Unfortunately, they were out of them.  We ate there anyway, and while we were there I saw two white families with adoptive black children.  It's amazing how you start seeing these things once you become acutely aware of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After eating, we went to Target and picked up a new action figure, did a few more errands, then caught a movie, The Spiderwick Chronicles.  This rated PG movie was a lot of fun, though perhaps a little on the scary side for six-year-olds.  Even though he closed his eyes for parts, Ethan enjoyed the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was quite a day for the two of us.  Apparently Jenny and Quin had a good time visiting with her family as well.  It's rare that you have a nice day like today in February.  Hopefully more are coming our way as spring slowly approaches.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/4338539397860558154/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=4338539397860558154' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/4338539397860558154'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/4338539397860558154'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2008/02/skiing-on-mount-olympia.html' title='Skiing on Mount Olympia'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-7640910770205856485</id><published>2008-02-19T18:44:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2008-02-19T18:57:12.638-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><title type='text'>Bringing Quin home</title><content type='html'>&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R7t4sgOemcI/AAAAAAAAACY/6MjozTG7J2M/s1600-h/IMG_3694.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: inline; text-align: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R7t4sgOemcI/AAAAAAAAACY/6MjozTG7J2M/s320/IMG_3694.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5168857703298013634" align="left" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Yesterday we got the call that Quin was going to be discharged from the hospital. It was going to be later in the day, so we took Ethan out of school around 12:30 and headed over to the hospital. When we walked into the nursery, we were surprised to find two doctors circumcising Quin. We thought that had happened already in the morning!  Well, it was somewhat interesting to watch, but Ethan was not so impressed.  He asked me what was going on.  After telling him, he was officially appalled and decided he didn't want to watch or be near that, so we went and found a TV for him to watch Zathura.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About an hour later, they were ready to discharge Quin to our care.  Since then, it's been your basic baby caring stuff.  He likes to eat, he does so about every three hours or so.  He also likes to sleep.  He does that in between eating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today we took him to see our doctor for the first time and all seems to be going well.  I did not remember how much time these little people can take.  It's not so much the amount of time you take tending to them, but running after things that you need to get for them.  Like today, it took us about 15 minutes just to get ready to go, then we drove all over the place to get to the doctor, went to Target to pickup a prescription and some baby things, then we had to go vote...  By the time we got back, we had been gone for like 5 hours.  So much for that novel I was going to write...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, here are some more pictures for your enjoyment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R7t4tQOemdI/AAAAAAAAACg/3rCGhAk6D08/s1600-h/IMG_3695.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R7t4tQOemdI/AAAAAAAAACg/3rCGhAk6D08/s320/IMG_3695.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5168857716182915538" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R7t4tgOemeI/AAAAAAAAACo/YT7CvSsXDlE/s1600-h/IMG_3703.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R7t4tgOemeI/AAAAAAAAACo/YT7CvSsXDlE/s320/IMG_3703.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5168857720477882850" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/7640910770205856485/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=7640910770205856485' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/7640910770205856485'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/7640910770205856485'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2008/02/bringing-quin-home.html' title='Bringing Quin home'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R7t4sgOemcI/AAAAAAAAACY/6MjozTG7J2M/s72-c/IMG_3694.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-8699379024788418041</id><published>2008-02-17T15:18:00.001-06:00</published><updated>2008-02-17T15:32:04.054-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Quin'/><title type='text'>Quinton Edward</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R7inwAOembI/AAAAAAAAACI/CFHMktVeXbg/s1600-h/IMG_3683.JPG"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R7inwAOembI/AAAAAAAAACI/CFHMktVeXbg/s320/IMG_3683.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5168065015543929266" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On February 16, 2008 at 10:47 AM, Quinton Edward Grady was born. OK, that will be his name assuming the whole adoption goes through, but since the birth mother has not named him, we will refer to him from here on out as "Quin." Quin was born via a Caesarian section delivery in a Madison area hospital. He weighed 6 pounds 11 ounces and was 19 3/4 inches long. He has a pretty good head of straight black hair and brown eyes (so far as we can tell).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were able to meet Quin at 3:00 yesterday, when he was about 4 hours old. He is being well cared for in the nursery. While we were there we had the opportunity to feed and change him. He is a decent eater already from what we're told. It's hard to remember hum much babies eat, but they said an ounce was a very good start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After spending a couple of hours with Quin, we were able to meet the birth mother for the first time, who was recovering in a different part of the hospital. She was doing well, happy to have her pain button. She wasn't real fond of the whole C-section delivery, but was in good spirits. It was nice to finally put a face to the voice and to get at least some idea of what features Quin might have as he grows and develops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethan is a very proud big brother. He made sure that he got equal time holding Quin and took lost of pictures. He even drew a picture of Ethan, Quin, and Dad in the hospital:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R7inOQOemaI/AAAAAAAAACA/LOqYMdmIOWs/s1600-h/EthanDadAndQuinton.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R7inOQOemaI/AAAAAAAAACA/LOqYMdmIOWs/s320/EthanDadAndQuinton.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5168064435723344290" border="0" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If all goes well, we should be able to bring him home on Monday.  More pictures will be posted to Facebook or Flickr, I haven't decided which yet.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/8699379024788418041/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=8699379024788418041' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/8699379024788418041'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/8699379024788418041'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2008/02/quinton-edward.html' title='Quinton Edward'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_5WpZdqukbMw/R7inwAOembI/AAAAAAAAACI/CFHMktVeXbg/s72-c/IMG_3683.JPG' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-4852698385579360245</id><published>2008-02-15T15:37:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2008-02-15T15:42:27.146-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>New Brother Coming</title><content type='html'>I'm putting a stake in the ground to start doing these again.  Perhaps once a week is a good goal, but I need to get it done...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So much has happened since the last time I 'blogged, it would be foolish to try to recap.  Instead, I'll talk about the most significant event of recent memory, our adoption.  Jenny and I have been trying to have another child for several years now, but with no success.  Finally last year we visited a fertility doctor who informed us it was unlikely to happen for various reasons.  Rather than try to get a donor egg and try invetro fertilization, we decided to pursue adoption.  Three weeks ago, we were finally selected by a birth mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should everything go through as expected, our birth mother should be giving birth any day now.

Ethan still is getting green slips at school, but he still tells us about it each time.  He also is learning his letters very well and is very good with numbers.  Jenny and I are both very proud of his schoolwork.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight was the annual Harvest Dance at school.  The gym had a bouncy castle and a bunch of games.  We spent nearly 2 hours there.  Ethan decided he wanted to go as a Power Ranger just in case one of his friends was there who was also a Power Ranger.  The best thing that happened, though, was Ethan lost his first tooth right there in the gym.  This tooth has been loose for weeks already.  A few weeks ago, Jenny and I discovered a new tooth growing in behind his baby teeth.  We, being inexperienced first time parents, took him to the dentist who told us to just let nature take its course.  I've been continually hounding him to keep wiggling it, hoping that the sure bet of braces could be avoided at least with this first lost tooth.  He has been afraid of having anybody touch it except for him, and he hasn't been that good at wiggling it either.  Last night I even tried playing a modified college drinking game with him saying that each time the word "bear" was used in the movie "Brother Bear," he should wiggle his tooth.  Tonight, his worries and ours were finally put to rest.  After putting a jaw breaker in his mouth, Ethan found that the tooth had finally worked its way out of its position.  There was blood all over in his mouth.  He opened up, and I did the final severing of the last pieces of tissue.  Jenny had a tissue that she gave to him.  Surprisingly, he didn't mind having all that blood in his mouth at all.  In fact, I think he kind of enjoyed it.  It didn't hurt or anything, he told me.  On the way out to the bathroom to clean up, he had to stop by the registration table to inform the ladies working there that he had just lost a tooth.  The rest of the evening he went up to each kid he knew and smiled at them, pointing at his newly vacant spot in his mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chalk another one up in Ethan's history book.  Today, Octoboer 27, 2006, Ethan lost his first tooth.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/116200552632566300/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=116200552632566300' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/116200552632566300'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/116200552632566300'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2006/10/first-tooth.html' title='First Tooth...'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-115863619538010477</id><published>2006-09-18T22:08:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-09-18T22:23:15.396-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Long time...</title><content type='html'>OK, it's been quite awhile again, but I thought the time was right to update some of Ethan's stats on this site.  Really what forced me to do it was some of the things Ethan said to me tonight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First thing's first, Ethan has an adult tooth coming in behind his existing baby teeth on the bottom of his mouth.  Jenny and I don't really know anything about this, so we took him to the dentist.  He has a very loose tooth that is about to be replaced by this much larger one, but it is not out yet, and the new tooth appears to be hindered by another not loose tooth on the other side.  Luckily the dentist said everything looks OK.  He seemed to be a bit concerned that he was getting these teeth already since his mouth is not big enough to accommodate these new teeth, but at least we're OK for now.  In the mean time, Ethan is very excited to have the tooth fairy just around the corner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm sure I've said it before, but putting Ethan to bed is the source of many very interesting conversations.  Tonight was no exception.  We started out with our prayers, like we normally do, and Ethan surprised me when he recited the Hail Mary almost perfectly.  He and I had been working on it for quite some time...  Well, I had him repeat after me when I said it, so I was surprised to find out that he knew it.  At first I thought he had just learned it from me and was fooling with me in not letting on that he knew it.  Then he let it out that they were actually learning it at school.  After I found that out, I think he thought I was upset that he didn't learn it from me, so he changed his tune and told me that he learned it from me.  I told him it was OK hat he learns things from his teachers...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later in our conversation we talked about what his uncles do for a job.  He asked first about uncle Rosco (Bryce).  I explained that he worked for the Electric company.  He asked if he drove a truck or if he fixed things, but I had to explain that he opened envelopes and processed payments.  It is a difficult thing to explain to a kid how people, like Bryce, my dad, and myself, can have jobs were we really don't do anything that they think of as work.  Explaining uncle Blaine's job was much easier, he's a teacher, and Ethan understands teachers.  Most difficult, however, was explaining how uncle Brett didn't work, he went to school.  To Ethan, only kids go to school, and uncle Brett was an adult.  After trying unsuccessfully to explain that uncle Brett was not an adult, I changed my tact to explain how you go to college when you are an adult, and that uncle Brett was now going to college.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last conversation turned to Santa Clause and the presents that Ethan wanted.  He explained some toy that I have never heard of, and told me that he's never seen it before either.  The toy is some spaceship with blinking lights or something.  He said that he's never seen one, but I told him that he should still ask Santa and maybe Santa would be able to make one.  Ethan told me that Santa couldn't buy it, so what would he do, make one with magic?  I said maybe.  He then said, "well what if some other kid gets that one?"  I said that Santa would maybe make two, to which he responded, "what if some other kid gets that one?"  I thought this was a pretty good step in the understanding of the concept of finity (is that a word?).  Ultimately I told him that Santa would never give him that present unless he laid down and went to sleep.  Yep, the same tricks that worked with me are working on my son now.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/115863619538010477/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=115863619538010477' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/115863619538010477'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/115863619538010477'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2006/09/long-time.html' title='Long time...'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-115310782520611528</id><published>2006-07-16T22:37:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-07-16T22:43:45.223-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Northern Exposure</title><content type='html'>It's a lovely evening in the North Woods.  This week is our family vacation, and this year we have chosen to spend it in St. Germain, WI at a cabin on the lake.  It's absolutely lovely up here!!!  We're not more than 30 feet from the lake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We weren't here for 10 minutes before Ethan had his swimming suit on and was in the water!!!  It's really amazing to me how he's taken to the water in the last few months.  Anyway, he no longer has any problem with water over his head (as long as he's wearing a life jacket).  The beach is literally 30 feet from our house, so he's been in the water more than he's been out of it for the last 30 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today he made a new friend.  Andrew, the 7 year old from next door, introduced himself and they have become fast friends.  It's hard for Jenny and I since Andrew is used to all kinds of independence.  Today they went over to the location of the "camp fire" without telling us.  I followed them (from a long ways back) and got yelled at when I finally caught up to them.  "Why are you here," they asked me.  "Just not ready to let my baby go," I should have honestly responded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grandpa and Grandma Grady are here today and tomorrow.  Tibbett's are coming on Wednesday.  Ethan really seems to be enjoying himself!!!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/115310782520611528/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=115310782520611528' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/115310782520611528'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/115310782520611528'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2006/07/northern-exposure.html' title='Northern Exposure'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-115155187168509802</id><published>2006-06-28T22:29:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-06-28T22:31:11.696-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Jack Black</title><content type='html'>I just found out that my son is cool.

Here it is...  "Why is the corn stalk mad?  -Because people are always pulling on their ears!"  Of course he followed this up with "Why is the bear mad?  -Because people are always pulling their hair!"  So maybe he doesn't have that great of a sense of humor...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clowns...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was Jenny's birthday a last week.  Ethan and I were outside waiting for her to go roller blading.  While we were waiting, I started talking to Ethan about Jenny's birthdy present.  Here's how the conversation went down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daddy - "Hey Ethan, you know it's mommy's birthday this week, don't you?"&lt;br /&gt;Ethan - "Yeah."&lt;br /&gt;Daddy - "What do you think we should get her?"&lt;br /&gt;Ethan - "Maybe a pretty necklace or something."&lt;br /&gt;Daddy - "That's a good idea"  &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;mommy enters &lt;/span&gt;"Shh, don't tell mommy what we were talking about!"&lt;br /&gt;Ethan - &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;nods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mommy - "What were you guys talking about?"&lt;br /&gt;Daddy - "Um, clouds..."&lt;br /&gt;Ethan - "Yeah, clowns."&lt;br /&gt;Mommy - &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;confused&lt;/span&gt; "Clowns?"&lt;br /&gt;Ethan - "Yeah, like they're funny and stuff.  And they have funny noses."&lt;br /&gt;Mommy and Daddy - &lt;span style="font-style: italic;"&gt;laughing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethan - "We weren't talking about your birthday present."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I'm 16...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last weekend, Grandpa and Grandma Grady were down to visit for a couple of days while Grandpa had a convention.  They brought down their old truck which they are going to be keeping here on a permanent basis.  Ethan loves this truck.  I'm not sure how it transpired, but Grandpa has apparently promised it to him when he's 16.  He was later talking to Grandma about when he could have the truck, and said, "not until I'm 16, right?"  Grandma nodded.  Then Ethan said, "Do you think Grandpa thinks I'm 16 already?"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everybody is naked...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, Ethan told Jenny and I that he was going to start a band and it was going to be called "Everybody is naked," and everybody in the band had to be naked.  We actually thought that would be a pretty good name for a band.  He got the idea when we were listening to the "Barenaked Ladies" during lunch...</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/115127228762163792/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=115127228762163792' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/115127228762163792'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/115127228762163792'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2006/06/things-kids-will-say.html' title='The things kids will say...'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-114839261413385033</id><published>2006-05-23T08:47:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-05-23T08:56:54.150-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>5 Years Old</title><content type='html'>My baby is 5 years old!  This year's birthday was particularly fun.  Not only was he really looking forward to his birthday, but he was looking forward to his parties as well.  So far Ethan's had 2 parties.  The first was on his birthday, last Wednesday.  We had the Abholds, the Witte's, and the Kelchen's over for supper and cake.  Ethan loved all of his presents he got there.  Then, last weekend, we went up to Minneapolis to have a joint birthday party for Ethan and Bryce with the Grady's.  Also very fun.  Jenny and I bought him a Rescue Hero Hyperjet, which is this huge carrier ship looking toy that Ethan loves.  He loves it so much that we had to put it in the van and cart it all over the midwest this weekend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grandpa and Grandma Grady secured a new motorcycle for Ethan.  They got it from a friend of theirs whose son had outgrown it.  Of course, we are just "borrowing" it as Teddy wants it back when we are done.  Ethan was very excited about the motorcycle initially, but his enthusiasm quickly faded when he realized he couldn't quite ride it yet.  I'm trying to get him outside on his bicycle more often to teach him how to balance better, so hopefully he'll be more excited about it soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more party to go.  We're having 4 boys over to the house this weekend for a birthday bash.  So far we know we are going to open presents and have cake.  Beyond that, I'm not sure what we're going to do.  Some sort of game, probably...  I'll post pictures.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/114839261413385033/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=114839261413385033' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/114839261413385033'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/114839261413385033'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2006/05/5-years-old.html' title='5 Years Old'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-114662160948285546</id><published>2006-05-02T20:54:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-05-02T21:00:09.496-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Wisconsin Dells</title><content type='html'>We took our annual trip to Wisconsin Dells last weekend.  We met the Hupperts, friends of ours from Seattle who now live in Baldwin, WI, at the Wilderness Resort for the evening.  Ted and Sue have two little boys, Teddy, who is 3.5, and Charlie, who is 1.5.  Ethan had a very good time with Teddy this time.  He gets along with kids younger than him very well.  Ethan is getting braver and braver as he gets older, but he is still a bit scared of certain things.  He had no problems going down all of the kids' slides, even the big ones.  I was even able to get him to go on a family tube ride one time.  It was pretty dark inside the ride, though.  After the ride he told me, "that wasn't so scary."  So I asked if he wanted to go again, to which he promptly replied "No!"  It was a fun weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethan continues to be very curious and seems to be learning quite a bit at school.  We pass a lake on the way to daycare on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and in lake there is an island.  He tells me that it is the "Galapagos Island."  He also told me today that hermit crabs are nocturnal, meaning they "sleep during the day and are awake at night."  He then parlaid that into asking if he could maybe get a "hermit lobster" someday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight was a big event for Ethan.  It was the first time he rode a two-wheeler bike by himself.  He got it in his head that he wanted to ride a two wheeler, so he made me take off the training wheels, and off he rode.  He didn't even want me to hold the bike up while he got started, but after a few failed attempts he conceded that he might need a little help.  He can go about 20 feet or so before he falls down.  Now he wants to practice each night.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/114662160948285546/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=114662160948285546' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/114662160948285546'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/114662160948285546'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2006/05/wisconsin-dells.html' title='Wisconsin Dells'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-114463581210230671</id><published>2006-04-09T21:12:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-04-09T21:23:32.113-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Ice Age - The Meltdown</title><content type='html'>Here's another in my series of reviews of Children's movies.  This time, Ethan and I went to see Ice Age, The Meltdown.  Ice Age 2 is the second movie by Blue Sky Productions (I think) under the Fox production company.  Like the first Ice Age, it is a computer animated movie about three prehistoric animals who became a "herd" of their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time around, the world is warming up and all of the animals live in a large bowl formed by an 80 foot high ice dam.  They have to make it to the other end of the valley before the end of the week before the dam breaks and they all drown.  Along the way, Manny, the mammoth, starts to believe that his species is extinct.  That is, until he meets up with a mammoth (I forget her name) that thinks she is a possum.  Her and her two "brothers" add hijinx to the film by injecting pop phrases and making fun of the other three.  Anyway, the gist of the movie is about loss and getting past it.  It's kind of a deep subject for kids, but I think it is enjoyable enough for them to stay interested even they don't really "get it."  You see, Manny lost his entire family (wife and child) to a group of hunters and he's never really gotten past it.  Now, faced with extinction, he has to try to get past his feelings of loss and try to start over with this new mammoth (played by Queen Latifah), but first he has to convince her that she is not a possum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I enjoyed this movie very much.  I would say it is quite a bit better than Madagascar, but still not quite as good as Shrek or The Incredibles.  Personally I liked Ice Age better than this outing, but Ethan tells me that "This one is way better than the first one."  I definitely recommend this movie to both kids and adults.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/114463581210230671/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=114463581210230671' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/114463581210230671'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/114463581210230671'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2006/04/ice-age-meltdown.html' title='Ice Age - The Meltdown'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-114463510985129393</id><published>2006-04-09T21:05:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-04-09T21:11:49.866-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Four Year-Old Wisdom</title><content type='html'>Nothing very long today.

This conference went much better than the first conference.  Apparently Ethan is progressing very well and doing a wonderful job in school.  He still needs work on his fine motor skills, but he at least knows enough to raise his hand before he talks.  I guess he still loves to tell stories.  In fact, he tells everybody that he is going to have a baby sister.  Unfortunately, Jenny is not pregnant, so that is just not true...  I guess he is the only kid in class that is an only child, and that makes him feel left out sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethan's favorite expression lately is "Awesome."  "Hey dad, look at this, isn't it awesome!?"  He has such emotion when he says it that makes it very exciting.

He is especially interested in how they get out of their mommy's stomachs.  I told him I didn't know but that he should ask Micky, our friend who is pregnant.  He told me that maybe the come out of their ears.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Last night, Ethan told me that poop comes from your brain.  Not sure how he came up with that one.

Jenny and I both liked it, although it doesn't have as much to enjoy for adults as do some other recent "children's" movies.  Will Ferrel is just a funny, funny guy.  I would laugh just watching him drink coffee.  He stars as the voice of Ted, George's human friend.  Very cute movie.  I recommend it for any child over the age of 3 (and I think they were all there today).</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/114040367818152511/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=114040367818152511' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/114040367818152511'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/114040367818152511'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2006/02/funny-sayings.html' title='Funny Sayings'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-113862770815853065</id><published>2006-01-30T07:22:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2006-01-30T07:28:28.373-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Pajama Day</title><content type='html'>Ethan is so excited.  Today he gets to wear his pajamas to school.  When I told him, the first thing he asked me was, "is everybody going to wear them?"  After I told him yes, it was full steam ahead.  He picked out the pajamas he wanted, made us wash them, and picked out some slippers.  This morning he told me that he didn't want any milk on his cereal so he didn't get his jammies wet...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We're also having interesting conversations regarding a new baby sister.  Ethan wants one, and bad.  We think the pressure is coming from school where they are discussing families in Spanish.  Ethan may be the only single child in his class, and I think that sort of upsets him.  Anyway, he has decided he's going to have a baby sister, and he's going to call her Paige Grady.  He will feed her, put her to bed, and change her diapers when they are wet, but mom and I have to change them when they are poopy.  Also, she is not allowed to use his bathtub because she might poop in there and that would make it smell...  These discussions have also brought up the inevitable, "where do babies come from" discussions.  He knows they grow in the mommy's belly, but he really wants to know how they get in there...

He is probably one of the youngest movie "quoters" that I know.  In the last few days, Ethan and I have seen a couple of new movies that are notworthy in that they have left an impression on Ethan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first movie we saw was during the Bears-Panthers game on Sunday, Hoodwinked.  Hoodwinked is the story of Little Red Riding Hood told from perspective of those involved, Red, Grandma, the Big Bad Wolf, and the axe wielding Schnitzel truck driver.  All in all it was a very funny movie and an interesting take on the fairy tale.  One of Ethan's favorite parts was when one of the characters said something strange then bowed off the screen slowly, all the while smiling, while another character said "awkward..."  What's funny to me is that I'm sure he has no idea what that scene, not to mention that word meant, but he thought it was so funny that he decided to quote it later to Jenny and I.  Anyway, I give Hoodwinked 3 stars and caution parents with children that have no sense of humor to stay away from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other movie we saw just last night was March of the Penguins.  This is a movie documenting the annual travels of the Antarctic Empire Penguins from the sea, where they can get food, to their nesting grounds, some 70 miles from any open water and source of food.  It was a very good show, much better than I expected, and pretty kid-friendly.  It is rated G, but I would say it is perhaps less kid-friendly than the likes of Hoodwinked, which is rated PG.  I say that because March has to deal with very difficult topics like death and starvation, which are somewhat alien concepts to a suburban American four year old.  At one point in the movie, the mothers have to go back to the sea (now up to 80 miles away due to continued freezing in the winter) because they have spent 1/3 of their body weight to deliver their egg.  When they finally make it and start gorging on the buffet of fish and crill, they are met by a hungry sea lion who, after some tense chases and close-up shots of his sharp-toothed open mouth, finally lands himself one of the mother penguins.  This mortified Ethan.  He would not (and has not) stop talking about it.  He kept asking me, "what is going to happen to her baby," and, "why did the sea lion eat that penguin?"  I tried to explain that sea lions have to eat, too, and if he didn't eat that penguin he might die.  Ethan didn't care, he hates sea lions now.  It got to the point that he started asking about other animals that might eat penguins.  "Do sharks eat penguins?"  Not really knowing, I said no, they eat sea lions.  Without hesitation, he looked at me and said, "well good.  I'm glad that somebody is protecting the penguins."  I give this movie 3 1/2 stars and recommend it to parents that are itching for some stimulating conversation with their children.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/113768261538621934/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=113768261538621934' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/113768261538621934'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/113768261538621934'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2006/01/march-of-penguins-and-other-movie.html' title='March of the Penguins and other movie reviews'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-113648570574932525</id><published>2006-01-05T12:24:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2006-01-05T12:28:25.766-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Little snot...</title><content type='html'>Wow, has my son turned into a little snot all of a sudden.

I asked him why, and he told me that he didn't like the things I said to him...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"What things?"

At the daycare Christmas program, you can only watch your child sing because there just isn't room for everybody to be in the LMR (large muscle room) at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, after Ethan's portion of the program was done, we joined him, his classmates, and their parents in his room, the 4 1/2 year old room for cookies and punch.  Ethan was sitting next to Jenna Weinfurt, who we've heard in the past, was his "girl."  Jenny and I got to talking to Jenna's mom, who claimed that Jenna had told her that Ethan was her boyfriend.  As those two were sitting next to each other, Jenna's mom decided it would make a cute picture, so she positioned herself across from the two of them and focused her camera and tried to get their attention.  Jenna looked right away, ready to have her picture taken, but Ethan was interested in something else (what, I do not know, but it must have been on the floor because that was where he was looking).  After several unsuccessful attempts at getting his attention, Jenna looked at him and said, sternly, "Ethan!"  Immediately his head popped up and he smiled for the camera, for what I assume was an adorable picture.  I guess this behavior either is instinctual, or it starts very, very early.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/113513208239658605/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=113513208239658605' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/113513208239658605'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/113513208239658605'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2005/12/another-christmas-program.html' title='Another Christmas Program'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-113457158816004402</id><published>2005-12-14T08:40:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2005-12-14T08:46:28.223-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Christmas Concert</title><content type='html'>Last night was Ethan's unnofficial first Christmas concert as a "grade schooler."  He's had a concert every year in daycare, but this is the first time he had an "audience."  Both sets of grandparents braved the 200 mile trek to see their grandson dance and "sing" Christmas songs with his classmates.  It was a nice concert, held in the church with all the other kids in St. Bruno's school, which includes kids through 8th grade.  It was obvious that he didn't really know Silent Night or We Wish You a Merry Christmas, but he made up for not knowing the words by doing a little dance while the rest sang.  It was pretty cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night Ethan and I had a somewhat awkward conversation.  First he wanted to know how babies got into their mommies tummies.  He was convinced before that the mommies didn't eat the babies, but he was wondering how in the world they got in there.  I'm not sure how I got around that one, I think I might have said that they are made in there or something.  Anyway, satisfied with my answer, he proceeded to ask how babies got out of their mommies tummies.  I told him that the doctor had to do an operation on mommy to get him out because he didn't want to come out.  I was pretty proud of myself for avoiding that whole uncomfortable situation, until he asked how Tim and Laura's new baby, Ava, got out of her mommies tummy.  That was when I had to try to explain something I called the "birth hole" to him.  He asked where it was, and I told him I didn't know (I couldn't take it anymore) and that he'd have to ask his mommy sometime.

It was one of the most relaxing, yet fulfulling days I've had in quite awhile, and will not be soon forgotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It started out last night, really.  The whole family went to Kohls to do a little "midnight" Christmas shopping.  OK, it was actually about 7:30 when we went, but for all intents and purposes (from Ethan's standpoint) it was close to midnight.  After fulfilling many of our gift purchasing obligations we went back home and watched the first 20 minutes of Sky High, a movie about pubescent super heroes.  It's a great movie, and I had a hard time making Ethan turn it off at 11:00 to get him to bed...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning, Ethan woke me up around 8:00 (my how things have changed since he was a baby) and we watched the rest of the movie.  Jenny had to go to work this morning since she is in the midst of open enrollment for her company and they haven't yet discovered the benefits of the Internet for doing things like this...  Before she left, though, she brought some breakfast up for Ethan and I which we ate while watching our movie.  When the movie finally got done around 9:15, we put on our snow clothes and went outside where we spent about an hour shovelling the snow that has been accumulating for the last three days.  Well, I was removing the snow, Ethan was playing in it and throwing it at me.  After a quick snack, we got in the car and travelled about 10 miles to a tree farm south of Dousman where we went Christmas tree hunting.  Ethan made several comments like "we look like hunters, don't we, dad?"  We walked all over that tree farm before finding a tree that both of us agreed on.  It's amazing what an opinion he has already at 4 and a half years old (never say that he's four!).  We cut down the tree, dragged it out to the road, and got into the car to warm up.  With our trophy safely tucked away in the van, we headed home to brag and display it to mommy, who was very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After lunch, all three of us now spent the afternoon making cut-out cookies.  Ethan enjoyed rolling out the dough, but especially putting his hands in the flour.  Once the cookies were safely out of the oven, Ethan and I went back outside for some more snow fighting and to bring the tree into the house where we could mount it the trophy room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, it was one of those simple days, not particularly taxing physically, and we didn't do anything out of the ordinary, but it is a day that I will not soon forget.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/113425761245801036/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=113425761245801036' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/113425761245801036'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/113425761245801036'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2005/12/treasured-christmas-memory.html' title='A Treasured Christmas Memory'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-113379216134455691</id><published>2005-12-05T08:11:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2005-12-05T08:41:12.640-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>First Birthday Party</title><content type='html'>Ethan had his first non-family birthday party on Sunday.  It was for Robert Dent, a boy from his daycare, who was turning five.  They had the party at M&amp;amp;M Gymnastics in New Berlin and it involved doing some tumbling and eating pizza.  Looked like fun.  Mostly, though, it reminded me how old Ethan was getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ethan also got to spend the day with our friends Micky and Tim on Saturday as Jenny and I had to go to a wedding.  Apparently he was a very good boy, and even helped Micky setup her Christmas village.  We were happy to hear that he was a good boy since it is always difficult to leave your child with friends and have them remain your friends for too long.  He was very excited to go to their house, but for a strange reason.  Jenny bought Ethan a shirt and tie for his upcoming Christmas concert.  The shirt came with a tie, and she also bought him another, more Christmas-looking tie to go with it, so he had two ties.  He was really excited to have a tie, but one of them was quite a bit too small for him.  So he decided that Jacob, Micky and Tim's 2 year old son, would like to have a tie as well.  Ethan wore his tie over there, on a t-shirt, and apparently spent the better part of the first hour over there trying to convince Jacob that he should wear the other tie.  Jacob did not agree, so Tim ended up having to wear the tie...</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/113379216134455691/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=113379216134455691' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/113379216134455691'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/113379216134455691'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2005/12/first-birthday-party.html' title='First Birthday Party'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-113339111177345907</id><published>2005-11-30T16:48:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2005-11-30T16:51:51.786-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>The Ghost with One Black Eye</title><content type='html'>Ethan told me a story today.

What impressed me the most was his sense of theatrics while telling the story.  He had different voices that he would use for the different characters, and whenever he was getting to a "scary" part, he would whisper very quietly.

Ethan has started doing a couple of remarkable things (in my opinion).  He has a pair of roller blades that he got from our friends Maylee and Jason last Christmas.  A couple of days ago he decided he was going to put them on, and now he's skating all over the house.  It's really fun to watch him skate from wall to table to stairs all over the first floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing he started doing lately was whisting.  For some reason, he thinks that whistling and snapping your fingers are very cool.  He hasn't quite cracked the snapping your fingers thing yet, but he is pretty close on the whistling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He's been such a good boy lately.  I wonder if it has anything to do with Santa Clause coming to town in a little over a month...</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/113254021478503718/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=113254021478503718' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/113254021478503718'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/113254021478503718'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2005/11/physical-achievements.html' title='Physical Achievements'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-113224103945403069</id><published>2005-11-17T09:22:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2005-11-17T09:23:59.473-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>First Snow</title><content type='html'>Yesterday marked the first snow of the season.

Todd and Theresa, my uncle and aunt who live near Madison, offerred to watch Ethan for the day.  He had a fine time, and the Hawkeyes won the game much to many a Madisonion's chagrin.  Ethan has always gotten along very well with Julia, the older of Todd's two children, but lately he has been doing more and getting along very well with John, Julia's younger brother.  John, who is a year younger, is taller and bigger than Ethan.  They really have started getting along very well together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning Ethan came downstairs all dressed, he had dressed himself.  He was bragging to his mom that his clothes matched and everything, even his shoes and the shirt he put on under his sweater.  This is obviously a trait that he is picking up from Jenny's side, as I have absolutely no talent in that area.  He was so proud of himself, and I was as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We've been working on our letters lately.  He's doing pretty well, though they aren't quite as interesting as super-heroes.  Maybe I'll try picking a superhero for each letter to help him learn that way.  Oddly, he knows S and E almost anywhere, for Superman and Ethan (his other favorite super-hero).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packer's won today over the heavily favored Falcons.

 &lt;/span&gt;My parents obtained a free night stay since they were treated badly at the Kalahari.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;They gave us the free night stay, so we traded it in for $129 off of a suite.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Not a bad deal.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;If you’re not familiar with the Kalahari, it is a huge hotel and conference center with a large indoor and outdoor water park attached.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;We’ve taken Ethan to this water park in the past when my parents were staying there, but this is the first time we’ve stayed there ourselves.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;The first thing we did when we got there, then, was to put our swimsuits on and head over to the water park.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Ethan’s first order of business was to run around like a crazy person in the wave pool.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;This kept him occupied for a half an hour or so, but soon he decided we had to explore the other regions of the water park.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;After a minimal amount of searching, we found the kid’s area with an immense rain structure surrounded by fiberglass animals and water slides.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Now this was fun.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Ethan started out going down the smaller slides and playing around the fiberglass animals.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;After awhile he discovered a slightly bigger slide that he was happy to go down for quite awhile.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;All the while Ethan was vaguely aware of some bigger slides on the other side of the structure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;After about 15 minutes going down the smaller slides, Ethan walked over and discovered the “lizard” slide.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;He checked it out on several occasions.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;He would walk over, look at the slide, check out some of the people getting off, then leave and go down the smaller slide again.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;He did this about 4 times before he came over and found me and asked me to help him find the lizard slide.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Half way up to get to the lizard slide he changed his mind and decided to go on the smaller slide again.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;After another 5 minutes, he did the whole thing over again from the start.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;This time we made it all the way to the top of the slide.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;He got in line, sat down on the slide, then decided he didn’t want to do it again, so he got off.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;After a couple of words of encouragement, he sat down at the head of the slide again, and this time he went down.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Jenny was waiting at the bottom for him.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;I don’t know what he looked like getting off the slide, but when I met him at the top again he was smiling from ear to ear.&lt;span style=""&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;He told me “I didn’t cry at all!”&lt;o:p&gt; &lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p class="MsoNormal"&gt;Tomorrow we’re going to try to get him to go down the bigger slides that Jenny and I can go down. &lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/113132673756123452/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=113132673756123452' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/113132673756123452'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/113132673756123452'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2005/11/kalahari-in-dells.html' title='Kalahari in the Dells'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-113080950370634891</id><published>2005-10-31T19:41:00.000-06:00</published><updated>2005-10-31T19:45:03.713-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Happy Halloween</title><content type='html'>I'm going to call this year Ethan's first Halloween.  Sure he has had four other Halloweens, but this one was special.  It was the first time that he actively participated and enjoyed himself.  He is growing so fast it is unbelievable, and I don't mean he is getting tall.  Instead of being afraid to go to any of the houses, he actively pointed out the houses that he wanted to go to based on what kind of candy he thought they would have.  In fact, he had been scouting the houses out for the week leading up to the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After we were done trick-or-treating, he said to me, "mission accomplished."  After that, he insisted on handing out candy to all of the trick-or-treaters that came up to our house after we were done.  All in all it was a very good night.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/feeds/113080950370634891/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=18512162&amp;postID=113080950370634891' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/113080950370634891'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/113080950370634891'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2005/10/happy-halloween.html' title='Happy Halloween'/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/115749026413078959590</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-6259699292989625154</id><published>2008-03-13T16:32:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2008-03-13T16:32:34.466-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>Is that the new green goblin or the old one</title><content type='html'>Is that the new green goblin or the old one</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/6039786972964159494/comments/default/6259699292989625154'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/6039786972964159494/comments/default/6259699292989625154'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2008/03/loose-teeth-and-doctors-visits.html?showComment=1205443920000#c6259699292989625154' title=''/><author><name>ropoman</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00233463456907535293</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2008/03/loose-teeth-and-doctors-visits.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-6039786972964159494' source='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/6039786972964159494' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-233275558'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='4:32 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-7043061948671111739</id><published>2008-04-01T09:24:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2008-04-01T09:24:31.900-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>This was a great trip.

Two thoughts- one is how proud I am that you and Jenny are so committed to this seemingly impossible but so worthwhile task. I so want to meet this granddaughter and hold her and tell her how lucky we are to have her in the family. She will find out how all of us cry for and with our children- especially when they make us so proud that there are no words to share that can properly express how we feel. &lt;br /&gt;My second thought is about traveling- your mother and I did a fair amount of this and your description rekindled my our desire to get out there and see the   real world that 90% of humanity lives in- for the most part, with much less but with more satisfaction than we all seldom express. We expect and want so much more than we deserve or the world can give us that we do not appreciate the many more gifts we enjoy than the vast majority in the world never give a thought to.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for sharing this- and what kind of beer will I have to buy you to loosen your mouth a little on those Papa John stories?</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/2506817289438248875/comments/default/1392100561161034601'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/2506817289438248875/comments/default/1392100561161034601'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2015/02/the-great-congolese-caper-day-8-on-way.html?showComment=1425148053695#c1392100561161034601' title=''/><author><name>Alleged father</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/18366203072606172351</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2015/02/the-great-congolese-caper-day-8-on-way.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-2506817289438248875' source='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/2506817289438248875' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-1610158215'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='12:27 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-3052272527922398784</id><published>2015-03-01T14:21:47.273-06:00</published><updated>2015-03-01T14:21:47.273-06:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>Won&amp;#39;t take that much, but I will find an AZ be...</title><content type='html'>Won&amp;#39;t take that much, but I will find an AZ beer for you to bring me back!</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/2506817289438248875/comments/default/3052272527922398784'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/2506817289438248875/comments/default/3052272527922398784'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2015/02/the-great-congolese-caper-day-8-on-way.html?showComment=1425241307273#c3052272527922398784' title=''/><author><name>Brandon Grady</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/14321607614557360562</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HcVDdmh6wTc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAhNg/vTkwNkDAaoA/s32-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://e-and-quin.blogspot.com/2015/02/the-great-congolese-caper-day-8-on-way.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-2506817289438248875' source='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/18512162/posts/default/2506817289438248875' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-25740888'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='2:21 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-18512162.post-3854651493135355975</id><published>2015-08-28T14:04:22.695-05:00</published><updated>2015-08-28T14:04:22.695-05:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>We loved visiting and getting acquainted with your...</title><content type='html'>We loved visiting and getting acquainted with your new lives!
