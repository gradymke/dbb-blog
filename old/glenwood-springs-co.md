A few weeks ago (well, over a month ago now), we took a trip to Glenwood Springs, CO. It was a trip to celebrate the end of summer and to get away for a little bit before the kids started school the next week. It was a nice long weekend, though the traffic coming down from the mountains left little to be desired.<br /><br />At a high level, we walked around, went on some long bike rides along the Colorado River, visited a wild west theme park on the top of a mountain, took a cave tour, and did the hike at Hanging Lake. For anybody looking to go to Hanging Lake, here are my recommendations:<br /><br /><ul><li>Get there early, or park at a rest area to the WEST and bike or walk to the trailhead. We biked - it worked great.</li><li>Take LOTS of water. We didn't...</li><li>It is a fairly difficult hike, particularly at the top. Mentally prepare yourself for that.</li><li>It is much longer than you think. Mentally prepare yourself for that.</li></ul><div>Rather than blather on about it, I made this short video composed of pictures and video that we took on the trip. Hope you enjoy it.</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe width="320" height="266" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/J8lTYZZKvLk/0.jpg" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J8lTYZZKvLk?feature=player_embedded" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div><br /></div>
