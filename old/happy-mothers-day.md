My boys really don't think much, normally, before a Hallmark Holiday like Mother's Day. Last night, however, Ethan asked me (discretely) what mom's favorite breakfast was. I told him that she liked an egg over easy with toast. He nodded, then said that he'd like to make that for her in the morning.<br /><br />So this morning, Quin (and I, I suppose) woke up a little after 6:00. He watched Garfield while I watched the inside of my eyelids for an hour more. Around 7:45, I heard Jenny stirring, watching TV in the bedroom. After another 15 minutes, I went upstairs to wake up my tweenager who had only 10 hours of sleep at that point, and told him it was time. He asked me what to do, and I told him. While Ethan was frying the egg, Quin made and buttered toast. Ethan got the egg just right on the first try, impressively! Quin then put a carnation in his teeth and carried the plate while Ethan poured some orange juice in a glass and delivered it to mom for mother's day! I have no idea how it tasted, but Jenny ate it all up, so either it tasted fine, or she is just a good mom - I suppose it could be both...<br /><br />It was a nice day today - seasonably warm and sunny with no wind. Quin and I were outside mowing the lawn a little later in the morning. He was bored, so I told him he could wash bird droppings off the house with the hose (aren't I a nice dad!). While I was getting the hose ready, he was looking in the sky and told me, "the sun tickles your eyes." Well, in Quinglish he said, "the sun tickles you eyes." I had no idea how poetic my 4 year old was!<br /><br />Happy mothers day to all (mothers)!
