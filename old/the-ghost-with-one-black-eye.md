Ethan told me a story today.  He asked me, "Daddy, do you want to hear a scary story?"  I of course said I did.  After which I was delighted to hear the story of the ghost with one black eye.  What impressed me the most was his sense of theatrics while telling the story.  He had different voices that he would use for the different characters, and whenever he was getting to a "scary" part, he would whisper very quietly.  It was one of the best stories I've ever heard, though I'm not sure I could ever retell it as well as I heard it.
