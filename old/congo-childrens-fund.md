This won't really benefit Mireille, but a family in much the same situation we are in has started a fund to help bring food to orphans in need in Kinshasa. We're planning on doing some fund raising to help this organization. Despite your feelings on international adoption, it's hard to disagree with helping children to get nutritious food and water.<br /><br />Please consider donating.<br /><br />http://www.congochildrensfund.org<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://static.wixstatic.com/media/2b8a4c_f3dccf6904af4c35b80aec3d230e75d1.jpg_srz_640_314_75_22_0.50_1.20_0.00_jpg_srz" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://static.wixstatic.com/media/2b8a4c_f3dccf6904af4c35b80aec3d230e75d1.jpg_srz_640_314_75_22_0.50_1.20_0.00_jpg_srz" height="196" width="400" /></a></div><br />
