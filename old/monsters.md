Quinny and I played "monsters" tonight.  That little boy has quite an imagination.  First he pestered me until I came to "play me."  So I followed him upstairs where he declared that he saw a monster.  For the next 30 minutes we were hiding, kicking, and even kissing the poor monster until his daddy put him to bed (both monsters).  Good times...
