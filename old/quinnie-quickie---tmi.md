File this one under TMI (that's "too much information" for those not in the know). I believe I've discussed how Quin and I have pee races in this blog in the past. On Friday I went on a field trip with Ethan, and to make a very long story much shorter, I didn't have much to drink during the day. When I got home, Quin wanted to have a pee race. While we were racing, I said, "wow, daddy's pee smells bad" (I told you this was too much information - you had been warned). Quin leaned forward and sniffed and said, "Yeah, it does. You need a new penis daddy. A black one!"<br /><br />I'm pretty sure mommy's been feeding him information...
