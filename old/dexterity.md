I'm just sitting here doing some scout stuff and Quin is sitting right next to me in one of his bouncy chairs.  What's different than normal is that he is grabbing <span style="font-style:italic;">everything</span><span style=""> within reach.  He has access to a bunch of toys within reach and he is studying each one of them intently.  This is a first for him and quite exciting for us.</span>
