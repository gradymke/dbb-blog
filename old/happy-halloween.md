I'm going to call this year Ethan's first Halloween.  Sure he has had four other Halloweens, but this one was special.  It was the first time that he actively participated and enjoyed himself.  He is growing so fast it is unbelievable, and I don't mean he is getting tall.  Instead of being afraid to go to any of the houses, he actively pointed out the houses that he wanted to go to based on what kind of candy he thought they would have.  In fact, he had been scouting the houses out for the week leading up to the day.<br /><br />After we were done trick-or-treating, he said to me, "mission accomplished."  After that, he insisted on handing out candy to all of the trick-or-treaters that came up to our house after we were done.  All in all it was a very good night.
