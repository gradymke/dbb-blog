I just wanted to jot some random thoughts down about Ethan so that they wouldn't be lost.<br /><br /><ul><li>The other day Ethan asked me, "Dad, is Jesus stronger than Superman?"</li><li>Ethan has quite an affinity for his "booty."  The other day, he pulled his pants down in the back, exposing his plumber crack, and asked me, straight-faced, "has anybody seen my underwear?"</li><li>He is very interested in babies and how they are made.  He is especially interested in how they get out of their mommy's stomachs.  I told him I didn't know but that he should ask Micky, our friend who is pregnant.  He told me that maybe the come out of their ears.</li><li>Last night, Ethan told me that poop comes from your brain.  Not sure how he came up with that one.  Everybody knows that's where boogers come from, not poop.<br /></li></ul><br /><a href="http://picasa.google.com/blogger/" target="ext"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/pbp.gif" alt="Posted by Picasa" style="border: 0px none ; padding: 0px; background: transparent none repeat scroll 0% 50%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial;" align="middle" border="0" /></a>
