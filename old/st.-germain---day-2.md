Day 2 was a lazy day.  The weather was beautiful and sunny, so we did a lot of swimming and hanging out at the campsite.  Along with your usual swimming, running, eating drinking, and sunshine activities, the following things stuck out:<br /><br />- Quin introduced the world to his "booty-butt."  Somewhere along the line he picked up the term "booty" as a word for his bottom, but he never really dropped the "butt" part.  Now he just says them both.<br /><br />- Quin and I did a bit of kayaking.  At one point I started singing "Row your boat," and Quin finished the song for me.  He is a wonderful singer!<br /><br /><br />- Posted using BlogPress from my iPad<br /><p class='blogpress_location'>Location:<a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=St.%20Germain,%20WI&z=10'>St. Germain, WI</a></p>
