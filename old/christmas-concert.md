Last night was Ethan's unnofficial first Christmas concert as a "grade schooler."  He's had a concert every year in daycare, but this is the first time he had an "audience."  Both sets of grandparents braved the 200 mile trek to see their grandson dance and "sing" Christmas songs with his classmates.  It was a nice concert, held in the church with all the other kids in St. Bruno's school, which includes kids through 8th grade.  It was obvious that he didn't really know Silent Night or We Wish You a Merry Christmas, but he made up for not knowing the words by doing a little dance while the rest sang.  It was pretty cute.<br /><br />Last night Ethan and I had a somewhat awkward conversation.  First he wanted to know how babies got into their mommies tummies.  He was convinced before that the mommies didn't eat the babies, but he was wondering how in the world they got in there.  I'm not sure how I got around that one, I think I might have said that they are made in there or something.  Anyway, satisfied with my answer, he proceeded to ask how babies got out of their mommies tummies.  I told him that the doctor had to do an operation on mommy to get him out because he didn't want to come out.  I was pretty proud of myself for avoiding that whole uncomfortable situation, until he asked how Tim and Laura's new baby, Ava, got out of her mommies tummy.  That was when I had to try to explain something I called the "birth hole" to him.  He asked where it was, and I told him I didn't know (I couldn't take it anymore) and that he'd have to ask his mommy sometime.  Hopefully he'll forget until he's 10...
