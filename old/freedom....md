Quin climbed out of his crib the other day.  We were working around the house and he was acting like he was tired.  He generally doesn't like to take naps during the day, but we like him to take naps.  So I put him in his crib and began to let him "cry it out."  I went outside to take care of something, and a couple of minutes later came back inside to find Quin standing downstairs, smiling at me.  He hasn't done it since, but we now know it is possible...
