Holy crap it's windy!!!  Short post for now. Jenny and Ethan are out looking at the little Colorado river gorge about 15 miles east of the south rim park of the grand canyon. It's not too cold out but I bet the wind is gusting up to 50 mph. It's so bad that it tipped over 2 portapotties. <br /><br />Quinny is napping. We left him in the car to start with but then felt guilty so now I'm hanging out with him. We are heading over to the main park in a couple of minutes and will post a full recount along with pictures later. <br /><br /><br />-- Post From My iPhone<br /><p class='blogpress_location'>Location:<a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Unnamed%20Rd,Cameron,United%20States%4035.918950%2C-111.563525&z=10'>Unnamed Rd,Cameron,United States</a></p>
