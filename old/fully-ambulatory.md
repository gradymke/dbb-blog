As of last night, Quinton has become one of the walkers of the world.&nbsp; He took his first tenuous steps from Jenny to myself last night before bed.&nbsp; Everybody was very excited.&nbsp; Well, Ethan was a little disappointed since he was in the shower when it happened, but was excited nonetheless.&nbsp; Looks like it's time to get the house to the next level of baby-proofness.<br /><br />Another score for the "nurture" portion of the nature vs. nurture debate.&nbsp; Quinton walked when he was 11 months, 2 days old.&nbsp; Ethan first walked when he was 11 months, 0 days old.&nbsp; These results are not scientific by any means.
