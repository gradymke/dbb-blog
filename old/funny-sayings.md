I can't remember the exact context, but the other day Ethan was saying some pretty funny stuff.  He was talking about liking something or not liking something (what, I can't remember), and a couple of minutes into it he said, "I changed my mind, I like it.  <span style="font-weight: bold;">I must be out of my mind.</span>"<br /><br />Today we took Ethan to the Curious George movie.  Jenny and I both liked it, although it doesn't have as much to enjoy for adults as do some other recent "children's" movies.  Will Ferrel is just a funny, funny guy.  I would laugh just watching him drink coffee.  He stars as the voice of Ted, George's human friend.  Very cute movie.  I recommend it for any child over the age of 3 (and I think they were all there today).
