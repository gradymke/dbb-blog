All good things must come to an end.  We pretty much just got up and left first thing on Sunday morning.  It was looking like a very hot day, and the time we did spend outside packing the cars found us swatting at a lot of mosquitoes which had been very sparse the rest of the week.<br /><br />Lots of interesting things happened during the week, but here is a quick summary of some of the more memorable things:<br /><br />- I lost my wedding ring (still haven't found it)<br /><br />- Quin learned to swim with a life jacket<br /><br />- We vacation with a very good mix of kids that get along with each other very well<br /><br />- Matt's boat started on fire on Saturday<br /><br />- We learned that an unopened bottle can explode when introduced to heat<br /><br />- Chantrelle mushrooms are quite delicious<br /><br />- Ethan learned to filet a fish (not filet-o-fish)<br /><br />I'll be publishing the vacation photos in the coming weeks, so keep an eye out.<br /><br /><br />- Posted using BlogPress from my iPad<br /><p class='blogpress_location'>Location:<a href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Prairie%20Dr,Oconomowoc,United%20States%4043.031455%2C-88.475567&z=10'>Prairie Dr,Oconomowoc,United States</a></p>
