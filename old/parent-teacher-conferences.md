We had our second parent-teacher conference with Ethan's teacher, Mrs. Matyas yesterday.  This conference went much better than the first conference.  Apparently Ethan is progressing very well and doing a wonderful job in school.  He still needs work on his fine motor skills, but he at least knows enough to raise his hand before he talks.  I guess he still loves to tell stories.  In fact, he tells everybody that he is going to have a baby sister.  Unfortunately, Jenny is not pregnant, so that is just not true...  I guess he is the only kid in class that is an only child, and that makes him feel left out sometimes.<br /><br />Ethan's favorite expression lately is "Awesome."  "Hey dad, look at this, isn't it awesome!?"  He has such emotion when he says it that makes it very exciting.  I think he truly thinks all these thing are "awesome."
