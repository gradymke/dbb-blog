As should probably be expected, since Quin went to bed at around 6:00 local time, he woke up around 4:30 local. I suppose the day was going to start early! We aimed to do quite a bit during this day, but ultimately decided to back it off a bit seeing as how we were still a bit groggy from the previous day's travels. We did manage to get to the <a href="http://www.superstitionmountainmuseum.org/">Superstition Mountain Museum</a> which is the site of an old Hollywood set for westerns which only recently burned to the ground. We also spent some time at <a href="http://www.superstitionmountainmuseum.org/">Goldfield Ghost town</a> where we got to see a gunfight, Ethan bought a cowboy hat, and we ended up taking in some old west entertainment at the Saloon.<div><br /></div><div>The day was not without excitement, however. In the morning, Jenny and I went to get some Starbucks and to get some things from WalMart, something we have to do each day during vacation. When I went to get my credit card from my wallet, I was shocked to find it missing! Luckily I remembered using it at a different WalMart the day before, and a quick call to them proved that I had indeed left it there. Something about vacations makes me sloppy with my wallet!</div><div><br /></div><div>At the end of the day, while my dad cooked chicken for supper and Jenny and mom went to Kohls to look for sweet deals, the boys and I were watching the Superstition Mountains turn different colors in the sunset. Ethan and I got onto the topic of Spanish, saying different phrases in Spanish to each other. At one point, Ethan said to me, "Say shut-up in Spanish." Quinton, without missing a beat, said "Shut-up in Spanish." Not a single hint of irony in his voice... He's got great timing, I'll give him that.</div>
