I haven't blogged in awhile. Part of it is sheer laziness. That compounds on itself in that there are just too many things to blog about so I just can't find the time to get it done. I'm in that situation right now. But something happened a couple of weeks ago that was too funny not to document - so here goes.<br /><br />We went to Noah's Ark - America's Largest Waterpark - last week for a last ditch summer celebration. To set the tone (since I can't tell a short story), I am building a deck, and had the guy coming out to auger the holes for the footings in the morning. My assumption was that he was going to be there for about an hour, from 8:00 until 9:00 or so, then we would leave after that. Well, that didn't exactly happen as planned. He was there for almost 2.5 hours, and the fun vacation day to the Dells started out with one very angry wife.<br /><br />No matter - we got to the park just in time to meet our friends and consume our picnic lunch that we had packed to save on money inside the park. As we were setting up our feast, Quinton and I went to the gate to purchase our tickets. As I was waiting in line to pay for and retrieve the tickets, Quin was watching all of the people walk by. At one point he said, almost under his breath, but loud enough for me to hear, "wow, there are a lot of pretty girls here." Later in the day he lost the shyness and started addressing people directly by saying, "Hello pretty girl!" to whoever he deemed worthy as they passed him in the park. Yes, funny and cute now... I'm not sure at what point it turns creepy, though. I told Ethan that he had most definitely crossed that line.
